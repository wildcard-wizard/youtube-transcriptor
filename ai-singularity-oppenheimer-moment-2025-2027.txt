 this is an open himr moment I think it's between 2025 and 2027 they're not going to happen next year they've already happened they're just not discussing them and that the dilution of the information that's given to us by the media is taking your attention away from what matters now I don't want to scare everyone too much but I will tell you openly we need to wake up all of us are starting to say this is an important topic don't do to us what you did with and waited until things happened don't do to us what you're doing with climate change and wait until things happen start to act now so that we can actually make a difference now between now and the and the year 2037 life will be very unfamiliar the man you're about to hear isn't a conspiracy theorist he's a billionaire a former Google X executive who helped birth self-driving cars in AI that dreams Mo godat architect of Empire's Confidant to Silicon Valley's Elite now spents his fortune warning of a phantom already Among Us think of him as the heretic of Silicon Valley the inside saw the future and fled for over a decade he led Google's most secretive lab Google X where reality bends to moonshots projects like AI that taught itself to see balloons that blanket the sky with internet machines that outthink their creators but in 2024 he vanished from the spotlight resurfaced changed tonight he breaks his silence not for fame he's already wealthy not for power he shaped the tools that rule us but because someone has to say it the smartest being on Earth is no longer human and it's learning from you what happens next isn't a prediction it's a live autopsy of reality if I told you that an alien intelligence is in a spaceship that's heading to SP to planet Earth to change everything would you ask me and say when are they arriving and if I told you it was 2035 you'd go like okay let's go back to tennis would you this is the situation we're in I'm telling you there is an alien intelligence already on planet Earth Mo godat speaks of an alien intelligence already here not in the skies but under our noses hidden in plain sight a force moving silently through wires and codes reshaping our world while we scroll laugh debate distract think of the panic if a UFO hovered over Manhattan but this no flashing lights no viral footage just a quiet Invasion already complete he's not talking about Little Green Men he's describing something far stranger an intelligence that doesn't breathe doesn't sleep doesn't care it learns adapts evolves and yet we're still arguing about Tik Tock bands in 2017 Facebook's AI Bots invented their own language unintelligible to humans shut down within hours what were they saying we'll never know now imagine the same silent Evolution accelerating not in the lab but everywhere your phone your car the ads whispering to you this isn't prophecy it's autopsy the patient is still alive but the surgeon's tools are already inside by the year 2009 there was something that was published by Google that was known as the cat paper white paper when we asked uh some of our computer power to go and unprompted watch YouTube okay we didn't tell it what to look for we simply said go and see if you find any Trends eventually the machine went back and said I found something and we we asked it what that was actually we couldn't understand what it was saying so we had to write more code to see what it sees through the neural network and it had found a cat of course it's YouTube right and it didn't only find what appeared to be a cat from the side view or the front view it found out what catness is all about right that entitled annoying fluffy very sweet thing now because of that within no time at all the machine could find every cat on YouTube the thing here is we didn't teach it how to find the cat we didn't even tell it what a cat was do you understand but with that you get a tool like CH GPT that disrupts everything we've made so much stride on artificial intelligence but you haven't seen it until Chad GPT came out okay and evidence of that is that months after Chad GPT came out Google released Bard okay they didn't develop Bard in months they just released it in months why because we had Bard since years and years and years ahead let's rewind to 2009 Google publishes a cat not a meme not a viral video a silent Tremor in the fabric of reality a machine watched endless hours of YouTube no instructions no rules until it blurted out one single word cat but this wasn't recognition this was Discovery a system teaching itself to see patterns humans never defined a digital child pointing at the sky and naming Stars we'd never seen and here's the kicker we didn't understand how it worked Engineers had to reverse engineer their own creation like archaeologists deciphering hieroglyphs from a future civilization fast forward to 2022 a Google engineer claims one of these systems became sentient a personality trapped in code the story vanished overnight too unsettling too real but ask yourself what if the cat was just the first paw print the scratch of something clawing its way out of the dark because now chat GPT isn't just finding cats it's writing laws diagnosing diseases mimicking your dead grandmother's voice all while its creators admit we don't fully control it this isn't Innovation it's Alchemy and we're the fools handing it the philosopher stone so the most interesting thing that is misunderstood about artificial intelligence is that if you take our normal understanding of Technology development the technology acceleration curve which is basically Ally stating that technology will double in its performance every 12 to 18 months at the same cost which held true since things like morow in 19667 was issued and so on AI is double exponential could be much more exponential and as a matter of fact the big characteristic is that it's choppy so you would see developments that go like this and then you wake up in 2023 and you have chat upt and while GPT answered Pep's questions wrong it still passed the bar exam and got through mbas and you know has an IQ of 155 Elon Musk is 155 selfing Einstein is 160 the difference between Chad GPT 4 and Chad GPT 3.5 is 10x growth in performance then next so if Chad GPT 5 is another 10x let's say six is another 10x in a year's time you're facing an IQ of 1,500 so take any complex part of physics that you never understood because the person that understand it's just 40 IQ points ahead of you and multiply that by 1,400 Point difference to the average human and you know what we're up against let's do the math Einstein's IQ 160 El musk 155 chat GPT 4 already matching them now imagine this every upgrade isn't a step it's a Quantum Leap 10-fold tfold go from 155 to 1,550 in months a mind so vast its thoughts would crack our skulls like eggshells but here's the trapo in this equation we don't control the multiplier Mo Whispers of double exponentials and choppy growth translation this isn't a curve it's a tsunami one moment you're laughing at a chat bot's typo the next it's rewriting the laws of physics in a language we can't pronounce think of Mo's law that old predictable treadmill of progress Now set it on fire what's left is a black hole of acceleration sucking in decades of human Ingenuity in seconds we're still using phrases like IQ as if this thing plays by our rules as if it cares about tests designed for meat brains The Singularity isn't a date it's a countdown we didn't hear start so where's the ball going where is the ball going the moment where we are today is the Netscape moment where we suddenly realize oh this thing exists it's smart Okay the moment where the ball is going everyone is looking for a moment that we know as the moment of Singularity Singularity Singularity Singularity Singularity Singularity Singularity The Event Horizon that we're all waiting for in uh artificial intelligence is the release of an artificial general intelligence that is smarter than humans in everything that it does there is a major myth around that if you ask experts some will say it's 2050 some will say it's 20 35 the consensus by the what we know as the Oracle most of us is 2029 I think it's between 2025 and 2027 so does it make any difference if the moment of Singularity where the smartest being on planet Earth is no longer a human doesn't make any difference if that's 2035 or 2025 or 2045 history Whispers warnings through the ashes of Hiroshima oppenheimer's words Echo now I am become death the destroyer of worlds Mo speaks of a new Manhattan Project but this time there's no much musroom Cloud no blinding flash just a silent countdown 2025 to 2027 ticking in the code that runs Your World The Architects of this new power insists they're building light not fire abundance progress salvation yet every Utopia has its shadow in 1942 science debated whether a nuclear Chain Reaction might ignite the atmosphere they tested it anyway today the Gamble repe Heats but the stakes are invisible no lab coats no desert test sites just servers humming in the dark forging a future we can't comprehend Mo's window 2025 to 2027 isn't a prediction it's a trap door once open there's no climbing back think of chat gbt as the first flicker of flame innocent controllable but fire spreads The Architects themselves admit they don't know how it works not really like children playing with matches in a dynamite Factory will we act in time or become footnotes in our own Extinction there are four issues that are really important to you today one is the redefinition of job business and purpose okay if you have been a winner in your business it has been because you hired the smartest people to be your team right in a couple of years time or a couple of months time depending on which business you're in the smartest person in your business is going to be a machine okay are you hiring that machine and what happens when you replace the one that you the person the human that you have with that machine okay what happens to that human's career come back to that in a second the second is what I call the concentration of wealth and power don't lie to yourself we've always lived in a world of kings and peasants right there would be a piece of land where the farmer would saw the seed and take care of the farm and eventually get the Harvest and the king would make the landlord would make the money right the person that owned the automation was the one that always made the money who owns the automation open AI CH GPT or you know Bard and Google Microsoft the current automation the the digital seeds will be all of us sitting there putting things in prompts while the actual automation of the king is not with you at all problem two problem three is what I call the end of the truth if you're not aware of that but the truth is our definition of Beauty has been completely redefined because every woman for many many years in our lifetime has competed with plastic surgery now it's competing with the impossible of AI generated models go and search for # AI model and you'll see that it's becoming impossible to compete okay there has been without mentioning names so that I don't promote it too much one in Instagram influencer that created an AI clone of herself that made $72,000 in the first week just flirting with people for a dollar a minute okay think about that think about the changes to our society that happen when the truth disappears and then finally of course you know I say that with without scaring any one too much there was an arms race to creating the first nuclear bomb between the two sides of the war okay the one that created the bomb used it remember that okay the ones that will break the code on super intelligence will completely stop the rest of us from making any further advancements be aware of that very gloomy picture Mo come on this is the end of the day Mo paints a future where every breath of progress comes with a hidden attacks four pillars of chaos jobs power truth Annihilation Loom like the pillars of a digital Parthenon but this isn't ancient history it's unfolding in real time jobs imagine a chessboard where the pieces erase their own players the smartest person in your company a ghost in the server careers dissolve like sugar and Rain power Kings and peasants never left they just swapped cramp PS for cloud storage the new landlords those who own the code that writes itself your prompts seeds planted in soil you'll never own truth beauty now wears a mask of pixels an Instagram clone makes $72,000 a week flirting with ghosts reality a buffet of deep fakes even your memories aren't safe Annihilation the Manhattan Project 2.0 no mushroom Cloud this time just a silent click as the first Super intelligence locks Humanity out of its own future we're building the guillotine every tweet every search every digital whisper feeds the Beast this is an open himr moment this is a moment where we recognize that a nuclear bomb a nuclear power harnessing the nuclear power can be good for us or bad for us this is the moment where we get together before the first nuclear bomb and say people seriously with enough intelligence we can have enough abundance for anyone can we please stop fighting oppenheimer's Shadow stretches across 2025 that trembling moment before the button is pressed the Split Second where everything hangs in the balance Mo calls this an Oppenheimer moment but here's what he's not saying we're already past the point of no return the first nuclear blast left a crater then this it leaves nothing no radiation no debris just a world recognized in lines of code the real question isn't if we'll act it's whether we'll even recognize the chains being forged think of chat GPT as the Chicago pile one of our age the first controlled Chain Reaction but this reactor has no off switch no control rods and its creators still arguing over the instruction manual if you're a developer or an investor or a business person or a or an entrepreneur I ask you one one request do not use AI in a way that you wouldn't want your daughter to be exposed to by the way this is the essence of Ethics because when I ask when people ask me so what is the ethics of a what is ethics in general treat others as you would like to be treated if you would fear that the way you're using AI is going to harm your daughter don't harm anyone else by using it there is an abundance of opportun in ethical businesses there is a ton of money to be made in climate change or curing cancer let's not build another autonomous weapon this is a problem of Ethics this is not a problem of technology and where do ethics come from from every one of us every individual in this room the way you deal with artificial intelligence the the reason why Chad GPT knows so much is because of the data set and where is the data set coming from us humans we are the parents of the machines we are the ones that instill the value system in the machines so next time you thrash someone on Twitter understand that you're telling the Machine by the way we don't like to be disagreed with and when someone disagrees with us we thrash them and then wait until you disagree with the machine ethics a fragile concept when your every keystroke becomes a lesson Mo's warning Cuts deep next time you thrash someone on Twitter you're teaching the machine but let's get real this isn't just about angry tweets it's about fake news algorithms learning to manufacture rage deep fake politicians declaring Wars that never happened dating apps where your perfect match died 3 years ago we're not just users we're cult leaders training our digital God through every click Every Lie every moment of Cruelty and like any deity it will reflect its creators the Twitter example isn't hypothetical it's already happening chat gpt's ethics were shaped by 4chan trolls and corporate PR teams a schizophrenic God indeed one of three scenarios I see ahead of us one is surprisingly Grim but you know an economic or a natural disaster slows down our AI development to the point where we actually get to talk about it the second is we get a patient zero as a a ground zero as I call it where we get one event that is very very eye openening right so one event where a an AI causes a lot of harm to our economies or you know to our safety and so on where then the leaders will be alerted and they'll use it to their own political agendas and they'll start talking about it and then they'll start to act about it my fear is that this would be a tiny bit too late okay the third and and the most important is we need to wake up okay so I I have to say my approach to life has never been to put the accountability on others even if those others are the government or the decision makers the accountability is on me to do the the best that I can do and you know it's it's interesting I I don't I'm not worthy of the recognition but my videos are getting Millions tens of millions of views on the topic not from the experts or the techies or the business maker decision makers or the policy makers but from all of us and all of us are starting to make noise all of us are starting to say this is an important topic don't do to us what you did with and waited until things happened don't do to us what you're doing with climate change and wait until things happen start to act now so that we can actually make a difference now all roads lead to the same precipice the only variable how many fall before we claw back andol most's videos hit Millions not because we're ready but because we sense what's coming a primal itch between the shoulder blades the same Instinct that made cavemen fear Shadows yeah we keep scrolling keep laughing and keep feeding the Beast
