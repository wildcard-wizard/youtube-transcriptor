 You are a Republican running for governor of California and you are currently leading the polls. >> Imagine that. Exactly. >> What happened to California, mate? >> It's an amazing place being completely ruined because we've had 15 years of one party rule. For the last 10 years, California is 50th out of 50 states. We have the highest taxes in the country for the worst outcomes. People are sick of it and they know that we need a change. parents, you know, they walk their kids to school and they're literally stepping over dead people who've oded from fentinel. I mean, this is just unbelievable. Driven by the desire to push this decarceration agenda downgraded a whole bunch of other crimes so that they wouldn't get automatic prison time. The rape of an unconscious woman now downgraded. trafficking a child for sex. A whole bunch of child sex crimes. I know. I know. And this Kla Harris pushed this. It just really captures the extent to which ideology has just taken over. >> If you are elected, if you are successful, how are you going to fix all that? >> Steve Hilton, welcome back to the show. >> Fantastic to be back in this very lovely setting. >> Well, we wanted to present you as a man of the people. >> I It's wonderful. This is positive populism as I used to describe it on my show. >> Well, very much in in in the vein of positive populism. You are a Republican running for governor of California and you are currently leading the polls. >> Imagine that. Exactly. >> What happened to California, mate? >> Well, a lot of bad things. I think that's the point. Um, this an incredible state as we can see. It's the most We were just talking about it. It's the most beautiful place in the world as far as I'm concerned. I'm traveling this state all the time. is magnificent. It's amazing. It's got got this incredible spirit and soul and the energy and it's all been crushed because we've had 15 years of one party rule. Democrats in charge of everything. The state legislature, all the statewide offices, governor, state attorney general, everything. If you look at the state legislature, it's actually 30 years or so. One party rule, total disaster. Literally, we have the highest unemployment rate in America. Unemployment. California enterprise innovation, highest unemployment rate, highest poverty rate, highest costs for everything that matters. Housing costs, gas prices, electric, water, insurance, everything. The business climate, Chief Executive Magazine does a survey every year, best and worst states to do business. For the last 10 years, California is 50th out of 50 states. US News and World Report, I think it was them, or someone did a survey just recently on opportunity. putting together all the measures for for that 50th out of 50 states school result you know everything homelessness obviously and that's the thing especially for people watching outside of California or even America there's there's all the kind of highly visible things that have gone wrong people can see the homelessness and and the crime and the and the videos of the retail theft all of that is true but underlying that the basics of living here are just a nightmare for regular working people and so it really feels to me like all that stuff that people say, "Oh, a Republican can't win. It's such a Democrat state. You're never going to do it." I just think that's not true. People are sick of it and they know that we need to change and that's what I'm running on. And so far so good. I think that it's a long way to go. The the primary is next June, general election next November. So this is far from being in the bag. It's the opposite of that. I'm fighting incredibly hard. But the idea that we can't change, that's not true. It really, really is. It's a classic thing. Time for change. And and people know that. There's a majority. Last thing I'll say, if you look at those like political people when they're looking at elections, they often say, you know, the indicator if if whether you're going to get a change of regime and an incumbent party or candidate is going to lose is that question is the state or the place or whatever it is going in the right direction, wrong direction. So in the last two years very firmly clear majority wrong direction California 60% 65%. So the conditions are there um I actually really think we can pull this off and it'll be a real revolution when we do. >> Well we've just come from Austin and it's fascinating talking to people Austin is like the refugee city for people who left California and what people I think don't understand is just how much of a paradise California is. >> It is incredible. >> The climate is incredible. The nature is incredible. You've got access to amazing food like you talked about businesses is an incredible place. And to chase so many talented, driven people out, >> I know, >> is quite an achievement. You know, this house is not ours. It's an Airbnb, right? We looked up how much this house I I I was curious how much it costs. >> Yeah. >> We looked it up. The price of this house has dropped by 40% in the last 10 years. >> Yes. >> Cuz wealthy people have left. >> Exactly. This is the thing. Like I actually say this I'm on the road the whole time. It's a political campaign speeches all the time and there's a kind of basic thing I say which is why would anyone leave an amazing place like this? It's because it's so badly run and it's impossible to live here and they chase you out. I mean the business you know I used to run businesses started companies here and and back in England and just including restaurants. I mean just basic you know these businesses that are so precious to you know the heart of a community bars restaurants all that just it's a nightmare it's end I just I mean there's there's so many stories I get them the whole time every day you collect cuz people tell you their stories a woman who tried restaurant owner in wine country near where I live up in the Bay Area near San Francisco she um tried to well she did eventually expand she built an extension to her patio for more guests to increase the number of guests from 35 to 50. You need a permit. You need to go through a process. It took six years and a million dollars. >> What? >> In fees, lawyers, inspections. You have to pay for the inspection, environmental report, this that it's typical. I mean, there's something called you, this is going to sound obscure, but it's a really good example of the insanity. uh just in terms of just regular you know operating anything in California you've got something called PAGA the private attorney general act passed in 2004 it outsources the enforcement of state labor law to to just lawy regular lawyers attorneys instead of the government it's become a total racket for lawyers trial attorneys as they say um who are by the way the second biggest donors to Democrat politicians That's why it's happening. Number one, donors of the unions. That's why the unions run everything. Number two, the lawyers, private attorney general has turned into an extortion racket for lawyers and the government. So the tiniest infraction like that's made up. You know, you spel someone's name wrong on the pay stop. Your break if you're running a restaurant after every 5 hours, you're supposed to give, you know, how certain number of minutes of break. One minute late and you're hit with a lawsuit. And these are costing businesses. They have to settle because you don't want to go through the process of going to trial. 60 grand, 70 grand, 100 grand. Bigger businesses millions a year. Just the cost of doing business. Just insane. I mean, there's so much over the years of this one party rule. It's just become this ridiculous bloated nanny state bureaucracy all paid for through higher taxes. They just keep spending money. They doubled the budget of the state of California in the last 10 years. Everything's worse. I mean, nothing work. It just California isn't working. And so, you're right. It's a beautiful place. And even I mean, the famous bits are well known, but I'm just on the road the whole time. It's huge. And you you go up north. Just this weekend I was up north. It's like you got everything here. It's like the the sort of west and there's ranches and cowboys and then you go up to the Sierras and the beautiful mountains that people know, but it's incredible everywhere you go. The coastline's magnificent. It's an amazing place being completely ruined. I mean, my last book was called Calopia, reversing the ruin of America's worstrun state. >> And look, I'm in agreement with you on that. I remember I came to California the first time in 2002, summer of O2. I looked around and I thought, "This is a paradise." Yeah, >> this is a paradise. And then you go to the places that I went for the first time, Santa Barbara, and it it's a completely different place. It looks downtrodden. It looks defeated. >> Disgusting. I mean, it's disgusting to me. You know, the the the lack of pride, you know, you've these these and it's not just the big cities, but the squalor, that's the right word. You cannot believe it. The filth everywhere, trash everywhere, of course, homelessness that's very visible. everything that goes with that. We literally have plagues of rats now like that's not an exaggeration because of because the squalor and then actually it's actually a really good example because of the they've banned a certain kind of rodenticide. So you go to the central valley I just when I drove here from from there just to be with you here today it's the greatest agricultural area in the world the central valley of California that's being ruined because they won't give farmers water because of their climate ideology. Um, they're banning they've banned a rodentic and there's plagues of rats. I mean, it's just a joke. But it's it's a warning to everyone because this is what happens when the ideology of the left just is allowed to run without constraint. It's a real warning. It's the worstrun state in America. And you got Gavin Newsome, the governor, sort of running around lecturing everyone on social justice and compassion and cruelty, whatever. Meanwhile, we have the highest poverty rate. As I said, one in three Californians can't afford to meet their basic needs. Food, shelter, healthcare. I mean, it's a total failure and and it's a really good indication that once you go down that road of the of today's leftism, this is where it leads. It's a it's a disaster. But also as well, look, it's a tourism, but let's be honest about it. You get the politicians you deserve. When we were talking about the excesses of wokeism and people going completely off the deep end, California was a literal punchline to many comedians jokes and for good reason. >> Yes. You are you saying you mean people voted for this crap? >> Yes. >> Yes. And I think that because everyone say how's how's it been allowed to happen? Well, partly because it is so nice here. So you can put up with a lot. I mean some people, you know, business people say well it's the it's the it's the California tax. It's the weather, you know, like you put up with all this crap to be here cuz it is so amazing. But I think it's got to the point well I'm, you know, my plan is that it's got to the point where that is it no more. We are going to change because we can't take it anymore. And actually there's I I just want to come back to the economic thing because you've got this situation where again the governor Gavin Newsome runs around saying, "Well, everything must be great because we're the fourth biggest economy in the world." And statistically that's true. Um it's a big economy, fourth biggest in the world. Great. But beneath that big number which is driven by a lot of really especially in the Bay Area are these big tech companies that are just making huge amounts of money but actually don't employ very many people at the same time. Yeah. fourth biggest economy in the world but highest unemployment in America, highest poverty rate in America. So that is not a wellbalanced healthy economy. And I think that's what is really, you know, coming home to root now for them, which is that the people that they claim to speak for, you know, regular working people, particularly Latinos, um, especially now the majority in California have just been completely screwed by this stuff. And that dream of, you know, the California dream and, you know, a good job where you make enough to raise your family in a home of your own, it's all gone. I mean it's it's just and I think people are getting sick of it and they they just need a positive alternative. That's what I'm trying to provide. >> And that's the question really is I mean you talk about the excesses of this kind of new version of the left and when it's taken to its logical conclusion with no challenge, no pull back, no no contest of of the ideas, no feedback from reality. >> Yes. >> And you're describing England the way that it is today. everything you're talking about business camp run you know homeless people crime all of these things right but the question is I think for many western countries now and for California in including >> is how do you get back from how far you've gone >> when you've got >> homeless people everywhere drug addicted people everywhere >> the the regulations that you've talked about like it's in a really bad way >> yes >> how do you how do you if you if you are elected if you are successful How you going to fix all that? >> A while back, I pushed myself in training because I'm a bit of a legend, but ended up with a back strain that took far longer to recover from than it ever used to. Nothing dramatic, just one of those moments where you realize your body isn't snapping back the way it once did. And as you get older, those moments start adding up. Turns out there's a real reason for that. Your stem cells are the repair system your body relies on. They're the internal maintenance crew that keeps you healing, recovering, and functioning. But that system slows with age. Fewer cells, weaker signals, slower bounce back. That's exactly why Qualia built their stem cell formula. It uses wellressearched ingredients like seab buckthornne and royal jelly to support your repair system so your body can keep doing what it's meant to do. And it isn't something you take every day. Just 4 days a month to help maintain your regenerative capacity over time. So, if you've ever felt like your body just doesn't bounce back like it used to, whether it's after a tough workout, getting sick, or the wear and tear of life, Qualia Stem Cell is for you. Qualia Stem Cell was designed to support your body's natural repair systems, helping you heal, recover, and keep going strong. And right now, you can try it for up to 50% off at qualia.com/trig. And here's a bonus. Use the code trig for an additional 15% off your order. That's Q U A L I A life.com/trig. Your body's built to repair itself. Qualia helps it to do that better. Big thanks to Qualia for sponsoring this episode. For those who are interested in, you know, how how the government, you know, works here. It's just it's a mirror of what you get at the national level. You've got the executive branch run by the governor and you've got the legislature like Congress. And the legislature is churning out all this crap. >> I mean, we all the time. And they have a super majority, the Democrats. We have two/3s majority, which by the way is not legitimate. It's the product of gerrymandered maps. Let's not get into that. Whatever it exists, it's a that means they can pass anything they want without any kind of input from Republicans. And they're just passing a ton of I mean, apart from anything else, it's just the amount of it. Like I just did an event in Sacramento, the state capital, just highlighting the sheer amount of legislation. Like this year, this calendar year, the this the session, they passed 1,117 bills. We stacked them up. We printed them out just to see. I mean, I know I'm short. It was literally double my height. Okay. And every year more crap pushed by lobbyists and and all the special all that stuff. So you can't really do anything about that as governor. You can't just unwrite laws. But what you can do is deal with the bureaucratic aspect of that. The you run the government and there's a number of things. So let's just take the regulations. I'll give you a really couple of specific examples. So one of the things that's most insane about this this this current ideology and actually if you look at like what's causing the most damage if you had to single one thing out is the climate extremism. Actually, when you look at like the real driver of the cost of everything being so high, including housing, it's this climate I call it climate elitism because the people who are paying the price for it are workingclass Californians. And that a ton of that is not legislated specifically is the way it's implemented by these endless agencies. We've got 200 plus state agencies like carb, the California Air Resources Board that are just churning out these new rules on everything from trucks and you know they have this thing called VMT vehicle miles traveled. that gets in the way of building anything because if you want to build anything you have to do a calculation of vehicle how many vehicle miles traveled will be the result of you building a new housing development or what a a guy who runs a lovely just sweet exactly the kind of business I love right it was an artisan gin distiller in the central coast of California beautiful young entrepreneur you know he's lovely business he was telling me that he doing really well and he wanted to build a second still like whatever you know I anything else to write and they you had to go through all the crap and it was denied because of VMT vehicle miles travel because it would increase vehicle miles tra Yes that's called growth that's called progress like more development more and they don't want that but that stuff is coming out of the bureaucracy so what as governor you can do you appoint thousands of people to hundreds of these agencies another example is or is when in the same sort of area oil and gas. So we have abundant oil reserves in California. I mean you know not just kind of behind us in Kern County 70 miles or so and I mean not the not as big as some of the states but I think we have the fifth biggest in America. We could meet we we used to produce most of the oil and gas we use in California from within California because of their war on fossil fuels. the climate warriors are shutting it down. So we now are in a ludicrous situation. We're using about the same as we ever did, but instead of producing it in Kern County near Bakersfield and it coming on a nice clean pipeline to the refineries here in LA and up on the coast in the Bay Area, um we're now shipping it in on giant super tankers, the most polluting form of transportation on the planet. They run on bunker fuel, which is like the most dirty, spewing out carbon emissions. Our number one supplier of oil now used to be California, used to be from here is Iraq where they produce it in a terrible dirty way, terrible human rights record, but that's what we're now doing. Um, all of and also our gas prices, we have abundant oil reserves now higher, the highest in the country, higher than Hawaii in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. >> That's just insane, right? And again, I want to come back to the the, you know, the man of the people point, but yes, because the first pledge I made in the election campaign, I mean, I've been working on all this stuff for years, but as a candidate was $3 gas, which to some people around the I mean, may not mean much if you're not watching in California, but like we have it's $5 and it's heading up to six and seven cuz refineries are closing because of all of this. And that really hurts regular working people who are driving 2, three, 4 hours a day to get to and from work because in their cars and trucks, that's like $100 or so a a month that you save with $3 gas. How will I get that done? Actually, you put people into these agencies, the air resources board or to be very precise terms of oil and gas production, calm, geologic and energy management. And the way they're shutting down the California oil and gas industry is not um there's no legislation that did that. It's it's the bureaucrats in that agency who are refusing to issue permits to maintain existing wells, to expand them, to drill new wells in existing oil fields, all of that can change almost overnight. So I can't do everything. But if you if you understand how the government works and you really have a a detailed plan, a little bit like Trump this time around compared to the first Trump administration, this time they were really well prepared and they kind of knew what they wanted to do, the people they wanted to put in the executive orders, all of that. So that's so on not on everything, but on a lot of these things you can make a big difference. I'll just quickly do homelessness because you asked about that. So the thing about homelessness is that it's it's totally avoid. It should never have happened. is completely avoidable. And the way I always put it is we would never allow someone we love to live like that. So why do we tolerate this for people we don't know? And the fact about homelessness is that it's illegal. It's it's illegal to sleep on the streets. These homeless encampments are illegal. They've always been illegal. and all these cities and and and county government, you know, local government in California, they just sort of put up with it because there was a supreme there's a there's a court case, I don't know, years ago called the Boise ruling. They said, well, you can't move people off the streets unless you have adequate shelter available. They hid behind that and said, well, and defined shelter as per what they call permanent supportive housing, which is an apartment unit that costs like $700,000 or going higher. That's not what that meant at They could have put people off the streets, taken them off the streets, put them in shelter, got them into treatment, but the law says you can't require sobriety or abstinence from I mean 80 plus% of people who are homeless have drug or alcohol addiction or mental health problems. So, it's just this mess that they haven't dealt with. The state as governor, you have state law enforcement resources. You have a police force you can use. And so I I say very clearly if they won't enforce the law, I will and I'll provide shelter and treatment and get people into what there's so many great organizations. They're just ready to do that. But they've got this attitude, this mindset of what they call compassion, which is you can't force people to do something. And the result is this squalor and danger. and and parents, you know, they walk their kids to school and they're literally stepping over dead people who've oded from fentinel. I mean, this is just unbelievable. >> To me, one of the major issues that California lost its mind >> was crime. >> It effectively seemed to legalize crime. And I remember watching this going, >> "This is completely not is it only bonkers, it's completely unsustainable. You've just the the the Democrat government effectively legalized shoplifting. I mean, if I'm >> Yes. >> talking out of my proverbial, please correct me. >> Okay. Do you want me to I'll get into it, but it's a it's a it's a terrible sorry story of >> it's what we do at trigonometry. >> I know. I'll get into it. So, okay. It actually goes back to something that I really can do something about as governor. So, it's worth really understanding the sort of detail here. So, it goes back to prison overcrowding. And there was a Supreme Court ruling, I don't know, this is like in the early 2010s, I can't remember exactly when, that said, California's jails, prisons, state prisons are overcrowded. It's inhumane. You got to do something about it. So, instead of doing what I think most sensible people say, right, well, let's build some more so we have room for the criminals that we need to put say, oh, no, let's let everyone out. And that's the way that you deal with it. So there was this whole process for a few years where the goal and it's a big part of what they call criminal justice reform was decarceration. Decarceration, taking people out of jail. And as a part of that, there was a whole combination of things. And the and the and the big one that related to um uh the point you make about shoplifting was a ballot initiative in 2014 called Proposition 47. And that was the one that famously is associated with Kla Harris because she was state attorney general. But to be accurate and fair, it wasn't her thing. It was a ballot initiative that was put together by, you know, leftist activists supported by the then Governor Jerry Brown. Very strongly supported. and she said she was neutral but actually as attorney general she wasn't at all. The way the language was written on the ballot initiative was basically selling. It was literally called something insane like not the name of it but the description and then all the marketing was the safe neighborhoods and schools act. And that's where you got this thing which is up to $950 a day you could steal per day and it would just be a misdemeanor like a parking ticket basically not a felony. So no jail time. The goal was to stop people going to prison. That was the purpose of all of that. And then behind that was not just the original impetus, which was the Supreme Court ruling on overcrowding, but also the phil the ideology, which is prison is bad because it's racist. So it goes back to the race woke thing because and you hear people talk like that today still, right? That we should shut all the prisons because it's racist. Why? because um there there are disproportionate numbers of black people in prison in jail um and especially young black men and as a as the woke ideology states any racial disparity is always the product of racism. Hence the prisons are racist so we have to shut the prisons. So you've had this, but that's the first thing that happened which was Prop 47 and that had the legalized shoplifting effectively and a bunch of other stuff as well, but that was the main one. And of course, what does that do? All the people that need to steal to feel their fuel their drug habit and then you get this massive explosion of retail theft and car breakins and car all of that stuff just exploded and there's nothing you could do because they said you all you get is a you know just a sort of nothing of a sentence. It's it's basically legalized. And and there were a whole bunch of other things. There's another one in a way even more absurdly egregious which was less discussed which is proposition Prop 57 which is 2 years later. And this one Kla Harris I would argue is more directly responsible for. And that one again driven by the desire to push this decarceration agenda downgraded a whole bunch of other crimes so that they wouldn't get automatic prison time. And they claimed it was only it was nonviolent offenses. They weren't touching violent offenses. But there's if you look at the list of crimes that they downgraded that could no longer qualify for automatic prison time. Literally one of them is domestic violence. Like it's in the name of the thing, but they said it was nonviolence. So domestic violence, the rape of an unconscious woman now downgraded. Trafficking a child for sex, a whole bunch of child sex crimes. Okay, so that's what happened. And it's just gone on and on and it was driven by this ideology of we can't have anyone in jail cuz jails are racist. >> So when they said the rape of an unconscious woman, do they mean that so effectively somebody who puts some a drug in a woman's drink? Yes. >> She becomes unconscious. He then goes on and rapes her. That's not a jail sentence. >> Correct. Not automatic. >> Correct. >> I know. I know. And this claim Harris pushed this as state attorney general. that she's more responsible for that than I mean in in the whole sort of national conversation and actually that first one I mentioned the $950 a day that was mostly reversed last year in an initiative that was passed called propos I'm sorry about all these numbers Prop 36 that kind of reversed most of that but the other stuff in Prop 57 they're downgrading all these unspeakable crimes that they wouldn't you could still get a jail sentence, but not automatic was the Republicans in the state legislature have been battling for years, literally for years, to pick them off one by one to try and reinstate them as and the definition is serious and violent offense. It's a definition in the legal thing that means that if it's if it's in that category, if it's called a serious and violent crime, it automat gets jail time. And you've literally if you follow what's goes on the state legislature the last two or three years friends of mine in the state legislature woman called Shannon Grove particularly has been strong on this has been you know year by year trying to get um child sex trafficking upgraded to a serious and violent crime and it was blocked by the Democrats time after time. She one year it completely failed. She had to come back the next year. It's insane. It is >> and and and it only in the end and and again it happened and there's about two or three of these examples and and and I can't remember the exact details but varants of unspeakable disgust the worst crimes involving children and sex with a minor you know selling a se a child for sex and they battled to actually turn you know give them the appropriate sentence and it was only finally that Gavin Newsome the government was so embarrassed he's running for president. I mean just this year had to step in. They voted it down. She was telling Sharon was telling me stories about she would have victims victims in the to the committees in the state legislature to give evidence. victims of child sex trafficking and they wouldn't let them speak because they didn't want to hear it because they're so and I think it re actually I'm really glad we got into this because to me probably more than anything else it just really captures the extent to which ideology has just taken over. ideology over all else. And it's this ideology of decarceration, criminal justice reform, prison is bad, can't send anyone to jail at all for anything. >> It It's crazy. And one of the other things I wanted to ask you about is you mentioned President Trump. Obviously, in his second term, he is having a real go at dealing with illegal immigration. >> Yeah. >> And the bulk of that seems perfectly normal and reasonable and good and right. But there are some excesses and people are pointing out and there of course protest here in LA. >> Yeah. >> Where do you come down on on the way that the border and deportations and illegal immigrations are being handled? >> Well, let's just talk about the the issue for for a start. I mean, you've got I mean, I hear this the sto this story the whole time and I want to put a few things together. Um, going back to what I was saying earlier, highest unemployment rate, highest poverty rate, all of this. So you've got there's a story that is told which is we need illegal immigration because we have a labor shortage and who's going to do these jobs and that's particularly strong in California some of the industries that you know like agriculture and construction and all of this well I mean I all the time I come across story I was at the sac the the California state fair in Sacramento went up to a couple as I do just saying hi I'm Steve got into a conversation and it was a family. It was the mother and a couple with their three children. And they just we just started chatting and I said, "What do you do?" He said, "Well, I work construction." "Oh, I used to work construction." "Why? Why do you say?" Well, I can't get a job anymore. Why not? Well, they don't want to employ people like me. What do you And he didn't want to say it. And I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Local people." And what he meant by that and we got into it was and the mother chimed in as well. And how I can't get a job. was now living with his mother, humiliated, right? He's a he's a man trying to provide for his family. He's now ended up living with his mother who's and the point they made was because it's they they want to hire illegal immigrants because it's cheaper. They don't have to pay um the right level. And then a really big one which isn't talked about enough, they don't and the mother chimed in with this. There's a video, by the way. I'm not You can watch the video. People can Google it on X, Steve Hilton State Fair. You'll see the conversation. Um and the mother said health and health care they won't pay they don't need to pay health care for illegal immigrants which is a big cost for an employer >> and then at that moment you just see it all come together because you've got employers who are it's basically a subsidy to employers this whole thing this it's a scam because while all that is going on and Gavin Newsome has been first introduced it and has increased it guess who does pay the healthcare for illegal immigrants the taxpayer cuz like he's giving free healthcare to illegal immigrants. >> Other states don't do that and it's a big amount of money. It's like this budget year he just increased it from I think 9.4 billion to 12.1 12 billion just for illegal immigrant healthcare just for that. And so the whole system is broken because and and then another thing you and you look at the the welfare payments as well and this this this idea that we don't have enough workers and we have to import the workers and that's why it's ridiculous because part of the argument about the about the immigration enforcement okay you get the high-profile incidents but there's a there's this thing people said well you're going to kick who's going to do the jobs if you if you do this well I was at a dairy in uh Hillar in um up the top part of the central valley. It was the biggest cheese factory in the world. So, one of the things I love about California, everywhere you go, it's like the biggest this in the world or the most what biggest cheese factory in the world. And I was talking to some of the guys who work on the dairy and they don't make a ton of money. They make like 4550 grand. And they were saying work full-time in the dairy. And they were saying their girlfriends make more money from welfare. So, you've got this crazy system going on where people don't work. Then you have people who do want to work who can't because of the legal immigration. So it's a mess. And and and the people who are losing out on from this all this are regular workingclass people. >> And by the way, this argument isn't true. Like in a market economy, you this is some something Eric Weinstein mentioned when we had in a private conversation we had is an obvious fact. in a market economy other than some very niche areas, you can't have labor shortages that you have to fill with illegal immigration because all you have to do is raise the price to a normal wage and the nor local people quote unquote >> and also reduce the ability to live on I mean here's another one I mean they I can't keep track of it all in near it was someone who runs a hotel owns a hotel just one I think maybe two near Sacramento he'd hired someone from Afghanistan um who was um actually brought in by the US government and the whole story was amazing. I mean he was this Afghan guy was he hired him to drive the shuttle bus to take guests to and from is an airport hotel and and he said the guy from Afghanistan was um telling him about his experience. He'd been flown from Afghanistan by the US government first to Virginia, then moved to Sacramento, given a house. Um they stocked his fridge. The guy he couldn't didn't know which bit of the government. And it was uh and the guy was told we we're going to um send you groceries by delivery because you shouldn't go to the grocery store because Americans are racist and you shouldn't go. Like imagine that, the government saying that. Anyway, he's then he's there. He's working as the shuttle driver. He says to the guy, "After 2 days, can I go uh can you pay me cash?" And he said, "Why do you want to do that?" I said, "Well, if I if I'm on payroll, then I lose my benefits, my welfare benefits." How what do you how much is that? $7,000 a month. >> What? 84 grand a year? >> Yes. 7 That's what he said. >> So, like when you So, it's just [ __ ] This whole the whole thing is [ __ ] >> So, it needs fixing. But my question to you was about the way it is being. Okay. So, first of all, the you can't have this conversation without just pointing out the extraordinary success of the border thing like closing the border. It's just an incredible example of when people say government doesn't work and government like incredible government action that it just basically stopped. You know, this flow of illegal immigration basically stopped to zero just with firm action that everyone said couldn't be done for decades and is just done just because there's someone who's really committed to doing it and has a team that was wellprepared and did it. So that's the that's good news. Then you got the problem of millions of people here and no one has an idea how many um who are here illegally and of the the whole argument is from the administration which is the the worst go first right we target criminals who are of course every illegal immigrant is a criminal in one sense because they've broken the law by being here illegally but on top of that another crime and Tom Hman who's runs the borders friend of mine I've known him for years and And he points he makes this argument which is that the reason that we have these kind of tough confrontations and the kind of pictures and the video that you that that cause people to be upset and sometimes have provoked protests and violent clashes whatever is entirely because we don't get cooperation from the local local and state government where we're trying to find people and and that is and here in California it's called it's a sanctuary It was a law that was passed in 2017, SB54, that said you can't cooperate with federal law, federal immigration enforcement. So literally, you have someone in jail for some or in the in custody in some sense in the system in California who's an illegal immigrant and has committed a violent crime or any kind of crime and they actively refuse to tell that person to to tell ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, that that person's there. So they could just night, you know, hand them over and say, "Here's this person." So that means that they have to go into the community to find them where they're hiding out after they've been released or whatever. And that is what causes both the confrontation but also um noncriminal illegal immigrants to be swept up in the whole process. So their argument is if we had proper cooperation, we wouldn't need any of this. That's the argument. I mean, look, I don't know. I mean, I actually, it's a federal issue. It's federal immigration. So, it's not something that I spend too much time on other than to say as governor, I would I think it's important to cooperate. It's federal. It's the f it's the law. Congress passed the law. They're just enforcing the law. I think there's, you know, this this idea that we can just pick and choose just on a mass scale. Well, we're just not not going to we're just going to ignore that. >> I guess the counterargument might be I mean, we had Sam Harris on the show recently and he talked about this in very different terms to you in terms of ICE agent not identifying themselves grabbing some guy off the street uh you know getting physical all of this stuff. Um and then he also talked about the fact that there are people whose kids are American citizens for example these people are being >> and look I think it's a >> voters will have different views on that. I'm just curious to know what your views are. >> But how many >> a small number I imagine >> like I don't know five six national it's a tiny number. >> Yeah. >> I mean nationally I think the total number of American citizens or permanent residents that have been according to the data is about 170. It's a country of like 300 million or whatever, you know, like this is and and so again that could even that tiny number could be avoided if you had proper cooperation >> and the people you're talking about are criminal, you know, I mean just look at the the the crimes that they've committed. These these are sex offenders. This is what's amazing to me. You have people on the left who are now literally taking the side of rapists and wife like that that famous guy, what's his name? Garcia Diego, whatever. He became a sort of, you know, national case. I can't remember the name. is a wife beater. Domestic violence and he's the hero. You have you Democrat US senators flying down to wherever it was to sort of hang out with him because they're on the side of the domestic violence perpetrators. It's just incredible. Why? Cuz they want to stick it to Trump. >> How does that make I mean that's what's ridiculous about this. And it could all be avoided if they were if if we just had a bit of common sense and cooperation. and they they just don't want to do that. And even within the sanctuary state law in California, they keep saying you have these, you know, local leadership and uh sheriffs and whatever saying we can't cooperate because it's the law. Even with I've read the law, even within the law that was passed in California, there's a long list of crimes where if if the illegal immigrant is involved in one of these mo over 200 ranging from, you know, what you'd expect an incredibly serious murder and whatever to actually, you know, um uh drug possession, illegal firearm possession that that the the word is discretion. There's discretion to cooperate. If only they did that, so much of this could be avoided. You wouldn't need to do it that way. And you talk about the masks. Why do they wear masks? Because of the doxing. These are people with families. Like they're literally they've been aggressive. You have very well financed what you know illegal immigration groups that are actively targeting law enforcement who are just doing the job that they're enforcing the law that Congress passed and they're being doxed so that they're and you have many stories of their families being threatened and so that's why they wear masks. Steve, >> by the way, these people who are now passing laws as they did in California, it is a little bit of an irony that, you know, after forcing us pointlessly to wear masks for all these years, they literally now pass law saying you banning maskearing. >> Well, I mean, nobody expects that side of the political spectrum to be entirely logical. >> At the start of a new year, everyone talks about resolutions, but most people try to brute force change with willpower alone and burn out by February. But have you ever thought about hypnosis as a solution? Hypnosis gets a bad rap, but it's not a gimmick. It's a legitimate therapeutic tool backed by research. And when it comes to weight loss, it can be a gamecher. Hypnotio is a self-hypnotherapy app that helps you break bad eating patterns by working at the subconscious level where the real habits live. It's for people who are done with willpower only plans. Hypnosio helps you tackle emotional eating, stress related cravings, and food anxiety using proven techniques that reduce cortisol, improve portion control, and build long-term habits. All in a way that fits into real life from your phone, tablet, or your computer. Clinical studies show that users lost twice as much weight as those using traditional diets alone, and 94% maintain that weight loss more effectively over time. It's not about hacks, it's about fixing the deeper programming. Hypnosis-based programs reduce BMI and emotional eating significantly compared to standard diets. So, what are you waiting for?

But more importantly, it seems that you're going to have to spend a lot of money, aren't you, in order to correct some of the problems that this state is facing. If you think about I look at the number of mentally ill people >> on the streets of this city there is no way in any shape or form they should be on the streets and you can say they've got drug addictions and I'm sure many of them do but they also profoundly mentally ill. We're talking schizophrenia here or other types. So they're they're going to need to be housed somewhere and many of them they can't afford to pay. So it's the state that's going to have to pay. You're looking at, you've already spoken about the fact that penitentiies were full to overflowing. We're going to need to build more prisons here. >> That's part of my plan. Exactly. >> So, so let's talk about that because that's also going to cost money if we're going to be honest. >> Yeah. But look at what they're spending money on. I mean, okay, they've doubled the budget of California in the last 10 years. It's gone from 160 billion to just over 320 billion. Okay. Where's that money going? Let's just narrowly look at >> um the homeless issue. So, this is and and the mental health costs associated with that. So their solution, and I touched on it earlier, there has this there's this thing they call permanent supportive housing. So they build apartment units for homeless people because it's the government. They layer on everything that you'd expect. So it's just unbelievable when you actually dig into it how it's like Britain in the 1970s. The unions run this state. So you have massive, you know, crony deals with the unions. So these apartment units I mentioned $700,000 earlier in the Bay in the San Francisco Bay area now they're costing a million dollars each in LA. You know the inc to build that money is from the same pot, right? I've got a friend who builds apartments using this new technology mass timber where you can you put timber. It's a really amazing new building material and you it's very innovative and it's whatever building apartments without without all the [ __ ] regulations. It's a quarter of the price. It costs four or five times as much to build anything in California as in neighboring states. So that's so that's all all the the that's where the budget's going. So you look at the money, there was an audit done not that long ago, $24 billion on homelessness with no discernable impact. The problem just got worse. So the money is it's not like we need to spend more. I'm We need to cut the budget of California, not spend more money. So, so there's two things I want to do is like reduce the budget because we got to cut taxes. That's that's the other. We have the highest taxes in the country for the worst outcomes. We got to cut taxes for a start and then we've got to spend the money where it needs to be specifically on mental health. Let's look at that. So, exactly as you say, look a lot of the people are low income. So when you talk about mental health care, it's part of the health care system and for low-inccome people that means it's Medicaid which is medical in California and that is federally reimbured. It's a very connected to the federal healthare system. Most of the money spent on that in California is actually federal money. And there's a massive scam that I don't even want to get into where it's classic California. They've got this medical provider tax that they've brought in which increases the cost of everything in order that they can attract matching funds from the federal government. It's just unbelievable. And of course, they're donors of the medical the healthcare industry who benefit from taxes go up. Nothing gets better. But one thing that's amazing about Medicaid and mental health is that when the system was set up in the 60s, they put in place this thing called the IMD rule, institutions of mental disease. And it's all based on that attitude of we can't have these big mental asylums. It's inhumane. One flow of the cuckoo's nest. All of that stuff. So there's a limit that was put in. If you to get Medicaid reimbursement from the federal government, you can't get it if your mental health institution has more than 16 beds. It's a very specific limit. 16 bed limit, which is insane. Imagine if hospitals had a 16 bed limit. How inefficient that would be. That's what we have for mental health for reimbursement from Medicaid. So the first Trump administration put in place a waiver so states could apply for a waiver so they they could ignore that limit. Cal other states have taken it up. California hasn't. So just there's all these things you can do to make things work. Just there's no the people in charge are clueless idiots who are just machine politicians who don't understand how anything works. They've no clue how to make anything happen. So within that massive budget, so I don't accept for a second that you need to spend more money. We need to spend less money and then what what's left after the reduction in spending so that we can cut taxes. You got to spend it better in sensible ways where you actually, you know, put condition, you know, outcomes based on what you're spending so you get results for it. You're not just putting into this corrupt pot. Well, it's there's so much corruption around this. I mean I mentioned the unions >> the there's this whole scam which is the unions filing lawsuits that's the other massive problem in California not just over regulation over litigation there's something called secret the California environmental quality act it's >> was in the 19 1970s Ronald Reagan when he was governor signed it was supposed to you know stop polluting factories whatever nice environmental protection we love it >> over the years it's been expanded to cover everything the courts expanded not the legislature, including housing 70% and then and then they granted this thing called the private right of action. Anyone can file a lawsuit. It's a bit like that private attorney general thing where you can just you get all these nuisance lawsuits. 70% of lawsuits under secret are filed to block housing. Most of those lawsuits are filed by the unions. The unions use them as leverage to to get what they call project labor agreements where they get deals from and they they negotiate. The two components of a project labor agreement are what they call skilled and trained workers and prevailing wage. Both of which sound very innocuous. Skilled and trained is a euphemism for union members only. It's the closed shop which we banned in England with Mr. Thatcher back in the 80s that still exists in California. It's amazing. and prevailing wage and of course it's much more expensive. I was talking to someone trying to in the central valley they're doing a housing development they carpet fitters you put the carpets in you need to have union labor mandatory there weren't any union carpet fitters in anywhere nearby they had to bust them in from San Francisco put them up in hotel I mean just mad right prevailing wage sounds very nice um this guy was telling me that he had a team of plumbers doing a job that was market rate uh $25 to $40 an hour. The same people on a prevailing wage job the other side of town $95 to $120 an hour and for the same work which actually by the way they take they spend three times as long doing the prevailing wage things. They get more money. So there's just incredible amounts of cost inflation built into the system because for years no one's taken a look at it and it just goes on. They pass these laws, the unions run everything. So to your point about when you say you have to increase spending, no, you have to get into all this like it should it's you know these we're spending money on apartment buildings that are four times what they should cost. Public money. So there's plenty of money there. >> And also but it's going to cost a lot more to build penitentiaries, Steve, to build and staff penitentiies. That's going to cost a lot more. Well, they've shut F four and there's a fifth that's about to close, Gavin. You so I' I've pledged to reverse that. You need to increase prison capacity. Um, but again, you don't tell me you can't find money in the budget for that for savings. I mean, the amount of bloat is just astronomical. And also by the way you can do I mean this is what one of the things I tried to work on back in the day in when I was in the UK government is payment by results where you actually put contracts in place where you don't just got hand out money you get paid in exchange for results and so for the prisons what you want the actual goal of it of course there's an accountability aspect you got to punish people hold them accountable for their crimes but you've also got to rehabilitate them because like what nearly half of the crime is reoffending so you want to reduce that and that's how you reduce crime and that reduces cost. So you can put there's all sorts of things you could if you had common sense practical people. I just want to tell a story if I might about the the kind of [ __ ] that's been going on in California and it's to do with the fires here in LA and it's a it's a little story but I think it tells so much about the kind of people you've had in charge. It's Karen Bass, the mayor of LA. And a few months into the, you know, recovery from the wildfires this year, and there's all this, you know, focus on permits and rebuilding and why isn't anything happening, and it's all so slow. And she and she, I saw a post on social media, and it from Karen, Mayor Karen Bass. It said, "I have just signed an executive order streamlining permitting for rebuilding in LA." Great. Well, it's 4 months too late, but whatever. I'll take it. And then it was above a clip from the press conference, a video clip. So I thought, okay, I'll watch what she actually said. So what she actually said was I remember it very precisely. I have just signed an executive order tasking agency heads with developing paths forward to streamlining permitting. And to me, that captures it all. These are [ __ ] people. They're process people. They don't know how to make anything work. They just spend money, spend money, nothing happens. And that's why you have this total mess on every front. >> Steve, last time we had you on, one of the things we explored is you mentioned your time in the UK government and you talked about the challenges any leader of Britain has getting any of their policies implemented because of what we in Britain call the civil service. >> I imagine the institutional resistance to a guy like you in this state is going to make that pale in in comparison. So you're going to have the entire institutionalized bureaucracy >> 100% >> sticking sticks in the wheels of your >> and lawsuits. I mean that's what I'm really >> So how are you going to deal with that? >> You got to be prepared. I mean I'm doing the work right now. I'm going through it. You know I've got a strong you know it's like running a campaign like this. It's a startup. You know we're trying to raise money. There's no it's not you don't inherit any kind of party resources or infrastructure anything like that. So it's not like we have unlimited far from it hardly any resources. It's very much a shoestring operation, but I've got really good volunteers. I've got someone, you know, like great, you know, legal people work because I think the lawsuits are going to be a big part of it. And you got to be be really clear about how you how you make things happen. And you just got to be really well prepared. You've got to have on day one think through how they're going to oppose it. But there's no substitute for just cutting their number. I mean, that, you know, that's where that's the conclusion I came to in the UK. There's just too many of them. and and so that's where all the you know bloat is coming from and you just got to you know reduce it massively. I mean here's an example. You just saw Gavin Newsome in the budget this year where we had a deficit in California. So all this spending and there's still a deficit um a deficit of 12 billion in the budget. You can't states can't have a deficit. It has to be you have to balance the books. And so five billion they did with accounting tricks um shuffling money to future years or whatever. And then seven billion he took from the rainy day fund which is supposed to be like a savings thing for something going badly wrong or when you're in recession. $7 billion in the same budget that he was stealing from the savings that are supposed to be for something completely different. He increased spending on the bureaucracy in California by the same and by seven it's exactly the same number seven billion dollars increasing the number of bureaucrats and increasing their pay and pensions and all this why corruption because he's running >> vote for him >> and the union the government unions he wants their endorsement and their money when he runs for president >> right >> and so you just got to I mean you just got to be direct about it and and take it on Well, speaking of Gavin Newsome, you mentioned him a number of times. He looks great. >> Great hair. >> Great hair. >> Well, I I as I say, >> no offense, mate. >> I say it's time for a government with less hair. >> That is what we need in We've had enough of the hair. >> But Gavin Newsome, I mean, he strikes me I don't agree with a lot of the things he says. He strikes me as a very capable politician. What does America get if it has a President Nuome? the the I mean the worst governor in America like a total failure on every front. I mean everything is a disaster and so his record I think is going to be totally disqualifying. He's got nothing to point to nothing. I just think that the more that that comes out um and the more details of that that come out I don't think he's got a chance because people will just look at that and say you know that I mean you remember that years ago that that classic ad on Michael Dukakus about don't let Michael he ran in 1988 he was governor of Massachusetts and there was very effective ad with just some you know filth and pollution in Boston Harbor or something I can't remember and and it was just don't let Michael Dukes do to America what he's done to mass Massachusetts. It was a killer. And I think there's just a lot of material from California. I agree with you. He's he's he's good at the politics and but that but that only takes you so far. You've got an actual record and it's a total disaster. And and I just think that um he's he's he's been able to escape because he hasn't had real challenge to that. you know, he hasn't really been taken on in a debate or, you know, I mean, he's had a couple of debates, but not really with anyone who can really get into the record and and expose the complete calamitous failure. So, I think that um uh you know, Hill is obviously running, he's been running for 20 years, people say it's all he's really been focused on, but I think it's just the scale of the failure. It's not just middling. We're literally like the the line I use all the time is we're top of every list you want to be the bottom of and bottom of every list you want to be the top of. It's a total failure. And he's and so I don't know. I can't I can't see it. I just can't see the country voting for, you know, looking at what's happened in California. Yes, please. We'll have more of that. >> Well, Steve, uh if you are successful in the election next year, you will it will be a political earthquake. I mean, there's no understating that. a Republican getting elected as governor of California would be quite incredible. So, so one of the reasons we were interested in having you on this early just to watch the journey and see how that unfolds. Uh that would be fascinating. We're going to ask you some questions from our supporters. A lot of them are residents here in California in a second. Before we do though, what's the one thing we're not talking about that we really should be? >> I want to say something about how amazing it is, how amazing this country is. Actually, >> you've been here too long, mate. >> No, no, no. I I understand, but I can sort of, you know, show up here and, you know, be in this position. >> Yeah, I was thinking about that. >> It's actually amazing and and it's beautiful. >> You're a first generation American running for governor of >> California. We moved here in 2012 with my wife and my two sons and I taught at Stanford University and I started a business and hosted a show on TV and now I'm running for government leading in the polls. It's amazing, you know, and I love this country and I'm, you know, I became an American 2021 and actually I I I've taken a step further. I've renounced my UK citizenship. Um, which I didn't realize this is a bureaucratic process you go through. You also have to pay I didn't realize that. I've just paid the exit fee, which is £482. So, I'm all in for California and America. >> Steve Hilton, thank you very much for being here. Head on over to Substack where Steve is going to answer your questions. What are California's greatest resources and how can executive policy immediately impact the employment of them without waiting on the legislature.
