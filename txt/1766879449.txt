 Angry young men. >> Farright extremist. >> Radicalized. Radicalize young men. Young boys. >> Young boys are being radicalized online. >> Give me liberty or give me death. >> If you're a man, doesn't it feel like every woman hates you? The data proves you're right. Young women are way more progressive than men at the same age. And more men are being painted as becoming radical and far-right extremists. But why is this happening? In this video, we're going to follow the data, the incentives, the institutions, and the history to figure out how the gender divide actually happened, why it's accelerating, and what we can do before you grow old and single. Take a look at the collapsing birth rates. A stable society needs 2.1 children per woman just to survive. But the female fertility rate in the United States, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, and Italy are all sitting at numbers way below replacement. But one thing is clear. This is a crisis and this is the most concerning data I've ever covered on this channel. This is why. Listen, I'll say the quiet part out loud that nobody wants to say. According to the data, the ideological shift is overwhelmingly happening on the female side, not the male side. >> But I'm always sh I think I'm just too old or something. I'm like, why is anyone married? You tell me. Why isn't Why aren't people married? >> Well, I mean, honestly, it's the women. The women are extremely liberal. No one talks about that, especially after the last election. There's a 45 point difference. >> The reason for that is not what you think. Here's where things get interesting and honestly a little bit bizarre because baked into this narrative of men becoming misogynists and radicalized is a paradox that I'm about to expose to you. The story you always hear is the same. Men are becoming radicalized. Men are falling into extremism. The manosphere is brainwashing young boys. But here's the contradiction, and this is the part that absolutely nobody wants to acknowledge. For some reason, men's ideology hasn't actually shifted that much. They've stayed roughly where they were about 10, 15, or even 20 years ago on many of the major points. And even compared to 100, 200, 300, and so on years ago, they're not radically different. A little bit more progressive, but not radically. The study we looked at earlier isn't the only one noticing this caked in trend. That's not my opinion. This is Pew, Gallup, Yuggov, take your pick. So, think about this logically. If men stayed the same and women moved, why is the entire culture narrative focused on the male radicalization? Well, because of one thing, there is an agenda. They have made it clear to us. And if they didn't want us to believe that, they wouldn't be saying it. In 2019, the American Psychological Association released an official guideline declaring that traditional masculinity, stoicism, competitiveness, leadership, risk-taking is inherently harmful. The United Nations through the He for She movement teaches that global gender problems originate primarily from male behavior patterns. Corporate advertising and HR from Gillette to Nike to Dove constantly portray men as violent, impulsive, or in need of ideological correction. All the while presenting women as morally superior. And academia, especially gender studies programs since the 1980s, have built its entire framework on the idea that masculinity is a political problem that must be dismantled and re-engineered. So the message is clear and coordinated across these institutions. Men are the issue. Masculinity is the problem and the culture must fix them. This isn't about, "Hey man, you're becoming too radical and it's hurting society and you need to stop." It's about, "We want you to fit into our program. We already socially engineered and radicalized women in the 20th century and now you just need to get on board with our agenda. Or else we will label your perfectly rational view of life in the world as radical until you simply get tired of it and throw in the towel. And frankly, from my experience and the firstirhand evidence of the internet, men are just not having that. That's why you have the reaction of the manosphere influencers like Andrew Tate and guys like that who I have to say I have my disagreements with as a practicing Catholic. you stretch a rubber band far enough, eventually it's going to snap back at you. Now, all of this starts to make a lot of sense when we look at the actual facts. And the facts are insane because the really radical stuff happens at the incentive level. The incentive structures that society has placed for women. The modern economy rewards women for becoming more liberal and punishes them for becoming more traditional. Think about it. Women now earn 60% of bachelor's degrees, 70% of master's degrees, nearly 60% of all PhDs, and universities are basically ideological factories. And their ideology is overwhelmingly progressive. And what exactly do universities incentivize for women? Career first identity, anti-f family framing, don't settle too soon, distrust of men, hyperindividual autonomy, therapy, language, morality, gender-based activism, secular spirituality over religious commitment. None of this is a conspiracy. It's just the modern incentive system. And I think they would happily admit that to you. And they're all trying to sell this perspective to you that it's all coming from an organic feminist movement. This is all just grassroots and it's just natural. This is a natural progression of life. But the evidence just becomes overwhelmingly against that. When we look into this with sober eyes, these schools are not neutral playgrounds. According to a Manhattan Institute study, seven out of 10 students in the US are exposed to at least one critical social justice concept in K to2 classes, even in private and parochial institutes. Another study found that most schools in North America teach left-wing racial ideology as if it were an established fact, even though it's highly disputed. Global parliamentary researchers in Australia concluded that progressive ideology is so deep-seated that most teachers don't even see it as an ideology anymore. And when you look at education schools, the institutions that train teachers, one historian observes that progressivism is the ruling ideology there. Again, none of this comes to us as a surprise, but these studies back it up. In other words, the pipeline for ideology runs from teacher training to curriculum to classroom, all from one source. And if you question it as a teacher, your entire career is at risk in places like Canada. The tenur professor Francis Widowen was terminated in December 2021 after publicly criticizing the university's indigenization agenda and other ideological positions. >> And you are no longer employed at Mount Royal University. What happened? >> An indigenous scholar activist because I was defending a journalist who had been pushed out of her job for referring to a book title that had a racial epithet in it. And as a result of that, this indigenous scholar activist by the name of Gabriel Lindström, who now goes by the name Gabrielle Weaselhead, she mobilized an anonymous student group against me. A whole bunch of her supporters piled on. I was found to have harassed her. An arbitrator later ruled her firing as disproportionate and unjust. Although she never regained her position >> because a number of indigenous scholar activists and a trans activist feel unsafe about me making arguments that they don't like. It has been the arbitrator decided that I couldn't return. >> This shows a concrete event where ideological nonconformity led to professional consequences in a university setting. But it's not only about firing dissenting voices. institutions themselves respond to financial and reputational incentives. A UK study found higher education reforms created perverse incentives for universities to shape behaviors and ideologies in order to secure funding and regulatory advantages. This data comes from the Institute of Fiscal Studies. Another paper documents how colleges respond to student aid, loan default penalties, and enrollment benchmarks by shaping admissions and outcomes. And a commentary in university affairs explains that there's no such thing as pure science. The interests of different parties shape the questions being asked and how incentive structures direct how those questions are answered. Let's put it simply. If a university is rewarded for diversity metrics, for activism, for social justice frameworks, then people inside it will naturally lean that way because that is how institutional survival, funding, and reputation are built. Now, it really seems to me that the problem that these ideologues are pushing is not that they have a problem with authoritarianism, but rather that the authoritarianism isn't of their flavor. The system is rigged to ensure one outcome. Go to school, you become progressive. Delay your family, become progressive. Enter corporate HR pipeline, become progressive. It's ironic for a position that always claims women aren't given a chance and given a choice in a patriarchical society. But are they really being given a choice here? Or is the outcome completely fixed? And if they were really given the choice, which one do you think they would choose? If we had a university program specifically funded and dedicated to training women to become better wives and better housekeepers, how many women would quit their STEM degrees in order to pursue that? Personally, from talking to a lot of women in my generation, I think a very high number would. But things only become worse when we look at the male situation.

But supporters of $50 a month plus are credited as producers with real input on future topics. Back to the plot. While women were being funneled into universities, corporations, and institutions that shape political ideology, men are quietly walking away from the entire system. And this isn't speculation. This is hard economic data. Over the last 15 to 20 years, more than 7 million prime age men ages 25 to 54, have disappeared from the workforce in the United States alone. Where exactly are they? They're not in school. They're not in training. They're not in job hunting. And they're not transitioning between careers. They're simply gone from the labor force. But why are they all suddenly Bitcoin millionaires and just don't need to work anymore? Are they living off the backs of female slave economy? Oops, wasn't supposed to say that one out loud. And today, the labor force participation rate for men is the lowest it's been since the Great Depression. Among young men, 18 to 29, the numbers are even worse. Unemployment has surged, not in education, employment, or training. Entire segments of young men are living completely outside the productive economy and the bounds of civilization. And how are they surviving? The data shows disability payments, welfare payments, parental support, random gig scraps, or literally doing nothing at all. Economists call this the male dropout crisis. Sociologists call it the great male opting out. And here's the core point. Women are being ideologically pulled into the system. Men are being economically pushed out of it. That means men aren't getting college indoctrination. Men aren't embedded in corporate HR departments. Men aren't absorbing ideological messaging 8 hours a day. Most men aren't even in the building. And so of course, men's worldview stays relatively stable. They're not inside the institutional machinery that rewrites ideology. Think about other times we've seen that in civilization. Things like this typically lead to some sort of a movement. This raises a question that nobody ever asks, but everyone feels. Why are corporations, school systems, governments, NOS's, pharmaceutical companies, makeup brands, food companies, clothing companies, literally every sector of society obsessed with shaping women's worldviews? Why do they spend billions of dollars every year on campaigns targeted at women? If women are supposedly tired of the patriarchy and finally empowered, then why does every powerful institution on Earth treat them like a demographic they have to constantly convince, recruit, affirm, and ideologically maintain? Think about it. Why do governments pour money into women centric advertising? Why do NOS's frame every issue through women and girls? Why is every corporate marketing department obsessed with female empowerment messaging? Why are pharmaceutical companies spending billions on contraception campaigns, hormone campaigns, fertility control messaging? Why do school boards and universities create bureaucracies around gender equality, women's studies, DEI for female students? Why do political parties build entire election strategies around the female vote? >> It is time for us to do what we have been doing and that time is every day. >> If women were naturally aligned with these worldviews, wouldn't you think they wouldn't need to be so sold? And you don't have to look any further than the gargantuan numbers they're spending. UN women's budget was $1.3 billion spent between 2010 and 2020 explicitly on programs to reshape gender norms and shift cultural attitudes. The US government has spent hundreds of millions annually around $200 to $500 million a year on gender ideology programs abroad. So these are programs outside of the United States. Over $4.5 billion spent on women and girls initiatives since 2000. Many of these programs openly target fertility norms, sexual norms, family planning attitudes, traditional gender roles, and they describe their goal as changing beliefs and behaviors at scale. Planned Parenthood's advocacy spends over $45 million per year on political campaigns aimed specifically at women. But here's the thing, you don't spend $und00 billion convincing someone of something they already supposedly believe. Where big money goes and where return on investment is unclear, the most plausible conclusion is that there's something they value more than short-term money. They're loyal to an ideology. And to see these insane tactics, all you have to do is look at where the money flows. The Rockefellers heavily funded the Women's Bureau, the National Urban League, and various women's reform initiatives in the early 20th century. John D. Rockefeller Jr. personally funded Margaret Sanger, the infamous eugenicist founder of Planned Parenthood, who said things like more children from the fit, less from the unfit. We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population and birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race. And the most merciful thing that a large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it. This is someone with zero empathy, zero concern for human life, and yet is being funded and placed at the center of apparently humanity's mission to enrich our lives. The Rockerfeller Foundation openly wrote that lowering birth rates among undesirable groups was a goal. Population control and social engineering were the two biggest research priorities. Now, take Alfred Kinsey. They even funded his studies based on sexual assault victims, lots of which being minors, that stripped these cases of their criminal status and used them as data points in his research, seeking to prove how sexual nonconformity is a good thing. His first grant in 1941 was $1,600. Not too much. But by 1947, his project was pulling in about $40,000 to $100,000 a year, which keep in mind is about $600,000 to $1 million in today's currency, among the tens of dozens, if not hundreds of other like experiments that they are also funding. This money financed massive sex history interviews, some involving minors, and set the stage for what many call the sexual revolution, which I did a whole video on called The Biggest Lie Ever Bought. If you haven't seen that, definitely go watch it after this video. It goes much more into detail than what I can do here. But the point still stands and the question is still unanswered. If a movement is truly organic, it spreads on its own. But if a movement contradicts human nature, you have to subsidize it. You have to incentivize it and you have to market it relentlessly. So why do governments and corporations treat women like a population that must be constantly maintained because the worldview being sold is not the worldview human nature defaults to. Women are not naturally hostile to family or motherhood or faith or stability. They have to be coaxed away from those things with promises of a hypothetical utopia, career fulfillment and sexual freedom, lifestyle independence, empowerment through consumption. In other words, if the product was really that good, it would sell itself. It doesn't. So, they market it harder. And that's why every institution is obsessed with winning women. And by who? Ironically, men. Perverted men. Ones like Michael Folk who advocated for the abolition of the age of consent laws in France. ones like Alfred Kinsey who used minor rape victims as data points in his deviant sex agenda. But it gets even darker than that because when you look at how he got to where we are now, you have to go back to the early 20th century because World War I and two did not just reshape geopolitics. They completely reshaped the culture of the home. See if you can notice the common denominator. Those two wars pulled tens of millions of men out of their houses, out of their communities, and out of their roles as spiritual and moral anchors of the family. And the architects and modernist ideologues behind the sexual revolution that we see today understood exactly what that meant. A home without a man is a home without resistance. While the men were overseas, women became the primary audience for every new form of messaging. Government propaganda, mass advertising, corporate marketing, film magazines, and emerging psychological techniques. For the first time in history, institutions had unfiltered access to the emotional and social center of the household. And they used it aggressively. This wasn't because women were weak. It's because women are the relational core of civilization. Women shaped the moral environment. Women are the gatekeepers of culture to a large extent. And modernists understood this. So, it targeted women first. That if it could get women to completely drink their Kool-Aid that men would eventually follow because they wanted sex. I think they got that wrong. But I'll explain that in a little bit. And you might be saying, "Zack, you're such a conspiracy theorist. All of this is just conservative propaganda." Well, then why did advertisers, Hollywood studios, and early PR firms like Edward Bernay openly write about this? He said, "If you want to change society, you don't start with the men. You start with the women because women influence everything downstream. The home, the children, the social expectations, and yes, even the behavior of men. There's a reason that 70 to 80% of all consumer purchasing decisions in North America are made by women. And here's where the manipulation of men comes in. Because modernists assume that once women embrace the new worldview, men would eventually follow. Not because the mens were ideologically convinced, but because the men wanted to stay in relationship with the women. In other words, if we convert the women, the men will cave. They'll go along with anything if it means sex, companionship, and peace in the home. But we must remember this isn't based off fact. This is completely theorized. And the thing is, for a while, it worked. For several decades, men did silently go along with the new cultural program because it was so incremental. It's like the boiling frog theory. You put a frog in boiling water, it's instantly going to jump out. But you put it in lukewarm water and slowly turn up the temperature, it'll stay until it cooks to death. But here's the theological reality. Man is not designed to be led by cultural propaganda. He is designed by God to lead by virtue. He is built to reject falsehood even when it costs him something, even when it costs him comfort or approval or intimacy. That's what Christ did on the cross. Christ showed us the true way of life that we must pursue truth all the way unto crucifixion. All the way until we have nails being driven through our very hands and feet and being crucified on the cross that our persecutors built for us. And that's what we're seeing now. the male opt out, the manosphere, the backlash, the Christian movement, the reactionaries, they're all waking up. Whether you believe it's misguided or not, it's fundamentally the moment when men stopped being willing to trade their integrity for acceptance. And once the sex is no longer enough to make men submit to the propaganda, the whole system starts to fall apart. Naturally, men aren't rejecting women. They're rejecting the ideological system that hijacked women. And the bad news to all the evil people behind us is that they will simply never win this battle because they fundamentally misunderstand human nature. And that's because they philosophically reject the creator of human nature. They reject the blueprint itself. And that's why they can't succeed. They don't understand human nature because they don't believe it was created. To them, people are raw material, pliable, programmable, and infinitely malleable. And if you just tweak the right knobs on the dashboard of society, you will get the result that you want, and you will control the society the way you want. And that's why their system is already cracking. Not because of some heroic rebellion, not because of a political movement, but because they tried to build a civilization on top of a blueprint that they don't even believe exists. You can't rewire men to stop being men. You can't rewire women to stop being women. You can't replace family with ideology. You can't replace virtue with dopamine. You can't replace meaning with activism. There's no version of reality where that works long term. And look, let's be honest, some people on the reactionary side see this collapse, too. like the Andrew Tates of the world, the manosphere guys, the black pill, the red pill, whatever pill movements. Even I, as a Catholic, can admit that they get some things right about the symptomology of the problem. But their conclusion is basically fine. Burn it down. Don't marry. Don't commit. Don't care. Stack cash. Sleep around and detach. >> Are you married now? >> I would never bring the state into my affairs. I don't chase women, Michael. I absorb them. >> But guys, I must say this is not the Catholic. This is not the Christian. This is not the Christlike approach. In fact, this whole video we spent discussing a lot of the sins of women and how women have fallen for the propaganda and drank the Kool-Aid in the sin of Eve. Women's fundamental flaw, which is rejecting authority and wanting to be deviant. And the ideologues and the architects of the sexual revolution understood that deeply and they exploited that. But we haven't gotten to the sin of men. The sin of men is simply inactivity. It's passivity. It's just sitting by and watching and complaining and detaching and becoming materialistic. That is the sin of Adam. Think about this. The fall would have never happened if Adam caught Eve in the act of eating the fruit and said, "Eve, don't do this. This is wrong. Obey me." But in fact, he didn't do that. He just sat by. And that's why the fall of man happened. It wasn't just Eve. It was a dual effort. It was a combined effort because the leadership that Eve was under failed its course. I understand that all of us feel like this is wrong and that we want to do something about it. But we have to analyze what moral groundwork do we even stand on to be able to assert morality, to be able to assert ethics. Because under an atheist materialistic worldview, unfortunately, we're a bunch of chaos. We're a bunch of particles clashing into each other in space. And knowledge is actually impossible. And in that system, tyranny is the only form of government that can ever logically work. Because Catholicism was the first framework that didn't ask me to pretend the world was better than it is or worse than it is. It just told the truth. And here's the truth of every ideology from the progressive engineers to the manosphere influencers that they keep missing. Men and women aren't arbitrary social categories. They're part of a design. A design that you can't rewrite without breaking everything built on top of it. You can fight nature for a little while. You can even force people to act against themselves for a generation or two, maybe three or four. But eventually, reality snaps back like a rubber band that you can't break. Every artificial system collapses under its own weight. Every ideology that rejects the creator ends up colliding with creation itself. That's why the Bible tells us that the wisdom of man will ultimately be made foolish in the eyes of God. Church attendance amongst young adults has seen its first spike in decades. Google searches for traditional marriage, Catholic mass, and Orthodox theology are at 10-year highs. And for the first time ever, over 60% of Gen Z says that modern dating culture is broken, hopeless, or antihuman. But guys, we can't lose hope. So, no, I'm not blackpilled. I'm not white. I'm not any color-coded internet philosophy. I'm simply Catholic. I believe that Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, and he is the author of life itself. The people trying to reshape humanity are standing on sand. They don't even have the tools to assert to you that what you're doing is right or wrong or that Catholicism is false. They don't even accept that truth exists. But the church, the thing that has outlasted empires, revolutions, and ideologies, and whole civilizations for 2,000 years, that is built on rock. Not because the institution is flawless, but because the anthropology is. And that's why I'm not discouraged. And the church, the one institution on this earth that is built by the author of that truth, isn't going anywhere. The gates of hell shall not prevail against the holy, Catholic, and apostolic church. Not now and not ever. Until next time, this is Zach with Lungs of Faith. Don't forget to like and subscribe. And as always, don't negotiate with terrorists. They want to count me out. Next time number the giant slumber. They want to keep me down. You're my worst.
