 We are heading into 2026 after gold has just completed the sort of year that makes newspaper editors reach for the word bubble and portfolio managers reach for the nearest legal disclaimer. More than 50 fresh all-time highs, a price that now feels wonderfully comfortable north of $4,000 an ounce and a calendar year return somewhere around 60%. Gold has outpaced equities, bonds, commodities, and cash. It has annoyed all the right people and I am thoroughly enjoying watching it do. So the question is will it continue in 2026. Let's find out. So gold, we know it all already. Record highs, big demand. But what do you do now? Do you assume the move is spent and take profits or accept that something deeper has shifted in the monetary landscape and treat last year as the opening act rather than the finale? Let's start with what the official frameworks say and then move pretty quickly onto the part that matters more. The World Gold Council's return attribution work here is useful to draw on because it kills the simplest narrative. 2025 was not a single cause frenzy. It was a broadbased move with growth, risk, uncertainty, opportunity cost, and momentum all contributing while official sector behavior sat behind it as the kind of structural force you only notice when it changes. Now, their valuation framework then offers the tidy conclusion that in a polite consensus world, gold should be more rangebound than explosive in 2026. If growth trundles along, rate cuts are gradual, the dollar weakens only modestly, and geopolitics remains a steady irritation rather than a genuine rap rupture, then today's price is not wildly inconsistent with that base case. Now, that is fair as far as it goes. The problem is that the base case assumes a functioning fiat regime that is still trusted and increasingly the story is that the trust is in the shortest supply. And this is where the language of ddollarization stops being a kind of dinner party conspiracy, if you will, and starts looking like an administrative trend. The dollar is not collapsing in a dramatic Hollywood scene. What is happening instead is slower, is duller, but it's more important. The incentive structure is changing. Countries that once treated the US dollar assets as neutral reserve instruments have been reminded that reserves can be frozen or payment rails can be restricted and financial plumbing can be weaponized. And when the world sees that a major sovereign's reserves can be made inaccessible, the lesson is not moral. It is operational. So your reserves are only yours while the politics allow it. Now gold sits outside that permission structure. It does not require a correspondent bank. It does not require access to a settlement network. And it does not come with the fine print of someone else's legal jurisdiction. And that is why central banks have been buying it in size, not as trade, but as a form of monetary sovereignty. Because even when the tonnage slows at higher prices, the intent, well, that doesn't. At $4,000 an ounce, you simply need fewer tons to raise the gold share of reserves to a desired level. the flow can cool mechanically while the strategy remains intact. Now this matters because it points to something unflattering about fiat because fiat does not die in one moment. It sort of decays through repeated exceptions. Emergency measures become normal measures. Temporary facilities become standing facilities. Deficits stop being cyclical and start being structural. The public is told that inflation is an unfortunate accident. While policy behaves as if it currency dilution is a feature, but the result is not instant hyperinflation in the west. It is something that's more realistic and for savers far more corrosive. Purchasing power is shaved quietly year after year. While the financial system becomes more dependent on confidence rather than collateral. Now in that environment, gold is no longer merely a hedge against inflation or falling real yields. It becomes a hedge against the political management of money itself. And that is the death of fiat story in modern form. It's not an apocalypse but a prolonged period in which currencies retain their names and lose their integrity. And the same theme appears in big bank research even when the tone remains politely technocratic. For instance, JP Morgan's analysts talk about a rebasing higher that is not exhausted, driven by ongoing diversification by both official reserves and investors. And they translate the idea into a flow framework, effectively arguing that there is levels of combined central bank and investor demand that sustains price progress and that incremental demand above that level lifts prices further. Now their forecasts and scenarios are almost beside the point because the important part is the mechanism. Gold is increasingly being treated as a strategic allocation because the buyer base is widening and the reasons for owning it have become less niche. Now Saxo puts it more bluntly in concept if not in their language. Their argument is that gold has undergone a regime shift. The old macro playbook in which rising real yields and a firm dollar reliably suppressed gold has weakened because the marginal buyer has changed. Official sector and Asian demand have absorbed selling that would have previously perhaps broken the market. Whereas gold's resilience through periods when it should have fallen is not a mystery. Instead, it's a message because f price formation is no longer dominated by western rates traders alone. All of this fits into a wider dolorization picture that is easy to misunderstand. This is not a world in which the dollar disappears next Tuesday. It is a world in which the dollar gradually becomes less singular. More trade is settled outside it. More reserves are diversified away from it. More countries build bilateral arrangements that reduce their dependence on US controlled rails. Now, that process can be slow and it can still be profound because the dollar's privilege rests on inertia and network effects. And once the incentives begin shifting, that direction can persist long after the headlines get bored. If you want a vivid way to say it, we are moving from a world of one unquestioned standard to a world of competing standards. Not necessarily competing currencies in the retail sense, but competing settlement realities. One system still runs on dollar collateral, treasuries, and western legal infrastructure. Another is trying to build redundancy with more regional settlement and more reliance on assets that cannot be sanctioned by keystrokes. You do not have to believe every colorful claim about gold corridors and dramatic monetary assets to accept the underlying point. The world is building backups. This is also why gold's role in portfolios is shifting. The argument is no longer simply that gold performs when rates fall or when markets panic. The argument is that the traditional diversifiers have become less reliable. Bonds do not always hedge equities when inflation and fiscal credibility are the actual risk variables. Cash yields are only comforting until policy decides that liquidity is needed and currency must be loosened. Gold awkwardly is one of the few assets that sits outside the credit system and outside the promise structure of the state. So rather than obsessing over whether gold should be rangebound in a model, it is far better to focus on the pressures that remain intact. First, official sector demand remains the anchor. Central banks are buying the thing that is hardest to freeze, hardest to default on, and hardest to devalue through policy. That is dd dollararization expressed as reserve management which is the least dramatic and most consequential form. Second investor diversification is turning into a slow reallocation. Gold share of overall investor assets has risen. But even in all of the published numbers, it is still small enough to leave room for expansion. In a market with relatively inelastic supply, modest shifts in allocation can produce outsized price effects, especially when translated into notional dollars rather than physical tons. Third, policy credibility remains fragile. The market is being asked to finance large deficits while assuming that central banks remain fully independent and fully committed to discipline. Yet, political pressure is clearly part of the story and so is fiscal dominance, whether it is called that or not. If the next downturn arrives with debt loads already high, the response is unlikely to be a sermon on restraint. It will be liquidity again. And that is how fiat dies in practice through repeated rescues that teach the public that currency is a tool, not a measure. Fourth, geopolitics is not a one-off shock, but a structural condition. Rivalry, fragmentation, and sanctions risk are now embedded features of the system. Gold is increasingly being used as strategic insurance against that reality, not as a temporary fear trade. There are still credible ways that this story calls. A genuine reflationary burst, stronger productivity, a firmer dollar, and higher yields could all unwind some risk premium and produce a sharp correction. Technical flows and positioning can create uncomfortable quarters even in a bull market. But none of this is a straight line. But even in the optimistic scenario, the underlying logic does not disappear. Debt does not vanish because growth improves for a year or two. Political incentives do not tilt towards restraint simply because markets prefer it. The fiat system does not regain trust because officials say the right words. Trust is earned by limits and the modern state has become allergic to limits. So is gold in a bubble at the start of 2026? The answer is no. What we are watching is not primarily a speculative blowoff, but a repricing of monetary confidence. Gold is doing what it has always done when currencies are managed aggressively and geopolitics becomes a variable in reserve policy. It is signaling that the system around it is being questioned. None of that guarantees a straight line to $5,000, but there will be corrections that feel in the moment like the end of the story. What it does suggest is that gold's role in a portfolio is becoming more central, not less. Precisely because fiat is becoming more political, more fragile, and more openly engineered. In that sense, the real question for 2026 is not whether gold will push ahead or pull back. It is whether the system that surrounds it can restore trust without resorting to the same mixture of debt, emergency measures, and denial that carried us from $35 to $4,000. If the answer is no, then last year's spectacular performance may come to be seen not as the end of something extraordinary, but as the polite beginning of something that should have happened a long, long time ago.
