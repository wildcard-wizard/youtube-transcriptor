 You know, I was sat here angry, shocked, and honestly quite sad due to what had happened in Bondi. Of course, struggling to find words for this video. This is a tough video for me to make. I've been speaking about Islam, the politics driving Islam in Western countries and the overall consequences for almost 2 years on this platform now. I don't speak too much about scripture and that from the religion itself. To me, that part, while it's fun sometimes, is a chapter that is somewhat closed for me as an ex-Muslim. What is more important is preventing Western civilization from embracing and turning into an experiment held hostage by Islam. And in doing so, over the past 2 years, I have covered a ton of incidents all around the world. But I genuinely would have never thought I'll be covering a mass casualty event that happened at home. At the time of making this video, 15 people have lost their lives with 30 more hospitalized. The perpetrators were a Muslim father and son duo. For those of you watching outside Australia, guns are extremely hard to obtain here. In this case, the father had a firearms license and legally owned six firearms, three of which were used in the attack. Now, this attack didn't come out of nowhere. The signs have been glaringly obvious. They couldn't have been more obvious if they slapped you in the face. Honestly, as I said on X, perhaps the clearest sign that there was something seriously wrong in Australia, specifically Sydney, was pretty much 2 days after October 7 in 2023. Watch this video. >> It was all very clear even back then. In fact, if you actually rewind back to October 7 itself, parts of Sydney that were heavily Islamic celebrated with fireworks. >> Yeah, bro. >> Live. Live from Green Acre. Live from Green. >> Oh no. Oh my god. >> In fact, this is a speech that was delivered in Sydney after October 7. Watch this. >> I'm smiling. >> I'm smiling and I'm happy. I'm enlightened. >> IT'S A DAY OF COURAGE. >> IT'S A DAY OF HAPPINESS. >> IT'S A DAY OF PRIDE. THE NIGHT OF VICTORY. >> THIS IS THE DAY. >> WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? >> SO WHAT EXACTLY DID Australia's leftwing government and the leftwing media establishment do in response? They played cover for these people. They said, "Oh no, they didn't say gas. They said where." Why did they want to know where Jews were to begin with? Did they want to go say hello? Shake their hands? Let's cut the [ __ ] here. Seriously, the Australian government simply allowed these tensions to fester. And in fact, you could argue they promoted the hate due to pressure from pro Palestine groups. When people marched with Hezbollah flags, nothing was done. When mass protests took place on the Sydney Hara Bridge with IS and Al-Qaeda flags with a presence from known recruiters and extremists, nothing was done. In fact, it was allowed to go ahead. Ironically, according to a letter that became public, the head of AIO privately described these rallies as a pressure release in a time of real terrorism. Well, turns out now, regardless, that terror attack has in fact taken place. And of course, all of this resulted in Albanese recognizing a Palestinian state even before a ceasefire was negotiated. This effort was seen by the US at the time as a hindrance to actual ceasefire efforts. So, let's talk about the driving force behind yesterday's attack because the media won't talk about it. The government almost certainly won't talk about it. In fact, if you look at Australian mainstream media today, they're still claiming they don't quite know if there was a motive behind this attack. As if it appeared out of thin air, as if there wasn't a long buildup that anyone paying attention could see coming. This is where the conversation always breaks down. Islam is treated as untouchable, as something that exists outside normal political or ideological scrutiny. And because of that, we keep pretending that violence inspired by it is mysterious or isolated or impossible to understand. Islam is not just a private belief system. It is a civilizational framework that makes claims about law and political order. And this is a key belief about Islam you need to understand because under this belief the world is divided into two broad realms. There's a territory where Islamic law governs and where Muslim rule is considered legitimate. And then there's a territory outside of it which is viewed as temporary and ultimately subject to change. That subject to change part matters. In this framework areas outside Islamic rule are not seen as permanently legitimate. Peace there is conditional, often temporary, and violence is justified when the conditions are believed to be right. When you understand this, attacks like this one and Europe start to make a lot more sense. This is where people get uncomfortable and where the conversation usually shuts down. Yes, most Muslims living in Western countries are peaceful. That's true. But they are peaceful largely because they live in societies that suppress the more radical demands of the religion. They are peaceful in spite of Islam, not because of it. The moment you move from cultural Islam to doctrinal Islam, from identity to obligation, the outcomes change dramatically. When people actually take the religion seriously and they believe it is a complete and final blueprint for how society should be organized, it doesn't produce progressive labor voters. It produces people who believe violence is justified, even necessary, in service of a higher cause. That's not a fringe interpretation. That logic is fundamental to Islam. Of course, not many politicians or the media class are willing to talk about it. In fact, incidents like this one and what keeps happening in Europe over and over again can be linked very clearly to one sector. And this is where I think we need to talk honestly about immigration, especially here in Australia, because this didn't just fall out of the sky. I don't think this happened because Australians suddenly became hateful or incapable of critical thinking. I think it happened because the incentives changed and once they changed everything else followed. Over the past couple of decades, Australia made a very deliberate decision to bring in a large number of people from parts of the world where Islam is the foundation of society itself. This mirrors what many countries in Europe have also done. These weren't small intakes that allowed time for gradual adjustment or assimilation. They were large, fast, and heavily concentrated in the same parts of the country. If you live in Sydney or Melbourne, especially in the West, you have watched this happen in real time. I don't think most Australians were ever asked whether this was a good idea. And once those communities were established, the political reality shifted very quickly. If you live in Australia, I think you would have probably seen what that looks like, especially in the past 2 years. And I think this is the part people underestimate. In Australian politics, elections are often decided by a handful of seats. In those seats, even a relatively small but highly cohesive voting block can decide who wins and who loses. Once that becomes true, politicians start behaving differently. They stop asking themselves whether a position is honest or sensible and start asking whether it's safe. Why do you think Tony Burke, after banning someone like Kyle Benjamin from visiting Australia, was happily seen welcoming unvetted gardens at the airport? Why do you think he was so adamant about returning is brides back to Australia? Is this not evidence of someone who's been entirely captured by his Islamic electorate? In fact, I don't even think such an important portfolio should be handed over to someone whose electorate is based off sectarianism. In fact, only this year, the premier of New South Wales, Chris Mins, had this to say. Watch. >> Australia doesn't have the free speech laws that are in place in America. And for one very important reason, because we have developed a multicultural community where it doesn't matter what your faith or your religion is, you must live side by side with your neighbor in peace. >> That's why criticism of Islam has become radioactive in this country. Not because these arguments suddenly stop making sense, but because saying them out loud now carries political risk. I am an ex-Muslim. In the country I was born, leaving Islam would have handed me the death penalty. But even pointing out simple realities like this, it's way too risky for even the most level-headed politician. You won't hear the coalition come out and point out any of this either. And they are the apparent right-wing opposition. And so everyone pretends not to notice patterns that are becoming harder and harder to ignore. I know for a fact that nobody is afraid of Buddhists or Christians or Jews doing anything like this. And just remember, this is only at around 3% of the total population being Islamic. We can see what happens closer to 10% in the UK and France. At some point, I think this conversation has to move past denial and turn into policy. Though, to be honest, I would think now is the perfect time. If a country brings in large numbers of people who don't accept its basic values, don't want to assimilate and become a security threat. Then something has gone seriously wrong. And when something goes that wrong, as we saw yesterday, you don't fix it with slogans or half measures. to do so is just pure delusion, a band-aid fix to appease the crocodile for even longer. Immigration systems aren't sacred. Citizenship isn't some mystical untouchable thing. These are decisions governments make, and they are decisions governments can reverse when the outcomes are clearly damaging. I know words like denaturalization or deportation sound extreme to people, but I think they only sound that way because we still don't want to admit how extreme the failure has been. 15 people died yesterday senselessly. Shouldn't the response be extreme enough so that something like this never happens again? The alternative is to just accept that nothing can be done and that violence becomes normal like the Germans have done for almost 10 years now. And I'll be honest, this is the part where I feel genuinely exhausted. not shocked anymore, not even surprised, just worn down by how similar all this feels because every single time something like this happens, the response follows the same script almost word for word. And I think a lot of people can sense it now. Oh, it's a religion of peace. Oh, not all of them. Oh, but it's a male issue. Oh, but we can't judge the religion. And everyone's personal favorite these days, don't look back in anger. But I don't agree with that. I think anger is a rational response when people are murdered and the country collectively pretends it doesn't understand why. I think looking back in anger is exactly what we should be doing because what's happening now didn't start yesterday. It's the result of years of denial, years of excuse making and years of people being told to swallow what they can clearly see. Hilariously, we're constantly told that the key to all of this is the moderates, that they are out there, that they are the silent majority. And yet, whenever Jews are attacked, whenever violence erupts, those voices are either absent or drowned out by justification and grievance. And often they become the victims, not the actual victims of the violence. This is the infamous tweet I use in response every time online. Condemnation, if it comes at all, is so carefully hedged that it barely registers. Meanwhile, anti-semitism in this country has surged to levels that would have been unthinkable not long ago. And it feels like the damage has already been done. What makes this even harder to watch is how quickly progressives rush in yet again to defend Islam whenever something like this happens. Not to grapple with the belief system, not to reflect on whether anything has gone wrong, but to protect the narrative, to warn about the backlash, to remind everyone that the real danger is saying the wrong thing. As if the priority in the aftermath of a massacre is image management rather than honesty. And because we refuse to address the cause, the response is always cosmetic. More bolards in the streets, more barriers at public events, more armed police standing guard at festivals that used to be joyful, maybe more online speech laws because Australia loves policies that make life harder for ordinary people while leaving the core problem untouched. The country becomes more restricted, more anxious, more securitized, and we're told this is the prize of tolerance. All the while, we're clinging to comforting myths that it's just a few bad actors, that moderation will save us, that if we keep avoiding the uncomfortable path of the conversation, things will somehow stabilize on their own. And I don't believe that anymore. I think a lot of people don't. Behind closed doors, people know what's happening. They know that there are many who aren't mourning today. They know that celebration and praise don't always happen on camera, but they happen all the same. And the most corrosive part of all of this isn't only the violence. It's the dishonesty that follows it. The feeling that reality is just being carefully managed while trust quietly collapses. I want you to understand this very clearly. None of what happened makes me doubt what I've been doing. It does the opposite. It makes me more certain, more resolved, and more confident that this work matters. I didn't start talking about these issues by accident. And I didn't stumble into them because they were convenient. I speak about them because I was born in and lived under the ideology we're pretending isn't a problem and because I've seen western societies repeat the same mistakes while insisting they're learning lessons. What happened in Bondi doesn't challenge my view. It confirms it. Silence has never made anyone safer. All it does is push consequences further down the road until someone else pays the price. Yesterday, 15 people paid that price. And that alone should end the pretense that staying quiet is the responsible option. So I'm not stepping back. I'm not softening this. And I'm not going to pretend I don't see what's happening just to make things easier for people in power. I'll keep saying what needs to be said plainly and without apology. Because the cost of honesty is still lower than the cost of denial. If there's any chance of stopping this from happening again, it starts with refusing to lie about the cause. And that's exactly what I intend to keep doing. In the neon haze of a broken steel towers, but the wild runs on. Shadow moves through the circus below. Half machine beast with a violet glow. They thought the outback was lost to the flame. But a dingo returned with a code in his vein. Save up my dingo. Racing through the nights on chrome. Eyes burning bright. Guarding a furious the can't control. Running on data but driven by soul. Heat. Heat.
