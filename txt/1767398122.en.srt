1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,040
You got to go.

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,120
>> Okay. I'm just asking. You can't push.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,679
Okay.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,880
They just literally pushed me out. Nick

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,759
Shirley, I hope you see this video.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,600
Please come to Columbus, Ohio. And if

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,119
you come to Columbus, Ohio, you will

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,960
find the exact same fraud. More Somali

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,480
fraud has been exposed out of Ohio. This

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,279
is getting out of hand and they're all

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,599
being exposed.

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,599
>> You get money through the state of Ohio.

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
doesn't matter.

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,040
>> This is a this is a money that gets

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,760
matter.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,320
>> According to one Midwestern Rhino

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,640
Republican governor, apparently fraud is

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,879
just part of doing business. Now,

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
>> it's a daycare center owned by uh

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,160
Somalians and stuff like that.

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,200
>> Have you ever seen any kids in this

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,200
place here?

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,640
>> No, not that I know of. I just seen it

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,160
the building itself. I've never seen

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,719
nobody come out the building or go in

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
the building.

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,320
>> You've never seen anybody over there?

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,640
>> No, not at all. Everyone has been

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,719
talking about Minnesota next. Surely the

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,039
empty dayc care is in millions or

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,360
potentially billions of dollars gone.

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,520
But we're going to be talking about Ohio

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,920
cuz that might be next. That might be

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,680
Minnesota 2.0 because right now people

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,840
are walking into daycare centers in

36
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,479
Columbus, Ohio and they're seeing the

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,640
same exact things. No kids, locked

38
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,040
doors, people getting aggressive when

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,520
asked basic questions. So right now we

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,720
are in front of the Great Minds Learning

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,720
Academy. This is one of the many daycare

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,040
centers, learning centers here in

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,360
Columbus, Ohio that are associated with

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,520
the Somali community. So, this place

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,040
here is the first place we're going to

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,280
knock and we're going to see if anybody

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,240
picks up or answers the door. Let's see.

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,159
So, it's locked. We're ringing the

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,600
doorbell here. Knocking on the door.

50
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
Nobody's picking up. So, we're not sure

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,759
what the hell is going on here, but

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,119
we're going to we're going to get out of

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,720
here now. There's somebody over there.

54
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,079
How you doing, sir? Did you you know

55
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,320
anything about this place here?

56
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,759
>> It's a daycare center owned by uh

57
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,479
Somalians and stuff like that.

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,159
>> Do you ever see any kids there?

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,119
>> Not cuz they use the back door. So I

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
want to know if they

61
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,000
>> they use the back door.

62
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,280
>> Yeah. I never seen nobody come in. But

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,440
they use the back door.

64
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,160
>> But But have you ever seen any kids? You

65
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
live around here?

66
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,959
>> Yeah. Yeah. On this building right here.

67
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,200
>> Oh, you're in this building?

68
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,200
>> Yeah.

69
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,760
>> You're in this building, too?

70
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,680
>> Let me ask you, have have you ever seen

71
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,440
any kids in this place here?

72
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,879
>> No, not that I know of. They use the

73
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
back. So, I've never seen nobody come

74
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
out the front.

75
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,680
>> You also see some potential SNAP

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
benefits that's being taken away, too.

77
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
So,

78
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,520
>> more Somali fraud has been exposed out

79
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,440
of Ohio. This is getting out of hand,

80
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,360
and they're all being exposed. Listen to

81
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,280
this. Somali in Ohio are allegedly

82
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,800
running EBT fraud rings using SNAP

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,280
benefits to stalk their restaurants,

84
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,360
skimming cards to make millions. More

85
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,840
than 34,000 Ohio households have been

86
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
duped out of nearly 17 million in SNAP

87
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,480
benefits from June 2023 to December 2024

88
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,879
with Somali migrant criminals using

89
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,800
scheming devices at grocery devices at

90
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,640
grocery stores to clone magnetic strip

91
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,319
cards and steal the money according to

92
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,560
the Ohio Department of Job and Family

93
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,319
Services. In addition, a recent report

94
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,920
details how Somali owned restaurants and

95
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,159
grocery stores in Columbus are

96
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,760
exploiting benefits. According to the

97
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,000
report, migrants own restaurants with

98
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,840
attached grocery stores that they own.

99
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,519
They buy their ingredients in bulk with

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
SNAP from their grocery stores, then

101
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,840
funnel the food to the restaurants where

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
they sell it for cash. One report claims

103
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,519
that the Somali migrant men who own the

104
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,159
restaurants typically have numerous

105
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,840
wives. That's crazy. They only have to

106
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519
claim their first wife so that

107
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,599
subsequent wives are able to collect

108
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,799
welfare benefits that are then used to

109
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,920
prop up the stores. And

110
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,360
>> yeah, they're Muslims and usually

111
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,959
Muslims are able to have more than one

112
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,760
wife. But you can see that they're just

113
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,120
they just know how to finesse the

114
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,560
system. They they're looking they're

115
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,319
going through loopholes. They know

116
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,440
exactly where to to go and find exactly

117
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,840
how to exploit and and really run away

118
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,080
with it by just connecting everything

119
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,840
their families to the business using all

120
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,319
these resources to extract more

121
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,959
resources out of the taxpayer. It it's

122
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,760
crazy.

123
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,000
>> This comes as as of a 2022 audit of

124
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,400
Somali Community Link. A Columbus

125
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,680
nonprofit funded in 2020 by Somali

126
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,239
migrants exposed a reported $2.3 million

127
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,480
in fraud from federal emergency rental

128
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
assistance program funds. The

129
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,400
investigation flagged missing rental

130
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,400
aid, violations of cash management

131
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,799
protocols, and in inadequate fraud

132
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,040
safeguards. Despite these failures, the

133
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,919
group tied to local politician via

134
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,280
campaign donations secured $350,000 in

135
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,680
state funding last summer for a

136
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,560
community center plus $100,000 from

137
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,880
Columbus for housing and youth programs.

138
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,479
Back in 2020, Somali brothers Hassan and

139
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,720
Abdurahim Norizo, former owners of Tofi

140
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,040
Market Market in Columbus, were indicted

141
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,160
for a 9-year snap in wick fraud

142
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,160
conspiracy totaling over $10 million.

143
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,720
The duo allegedly swapped benefits for

144
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,800
cash at half the value. Abdurahim, who

145
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,479
oversaw operations, was sentenced to two

146
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,560
years behind bars. Hassan got house

147
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,080
arrest and probation after a guilty

148
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,600
plea. So, you can defraud SNAP benefits

149
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,160
for $10 million and you get house arrest

150
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,000
and probation. Only if you're Somalian,

151
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,919
I guess, because if I do that and you

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
and I do that, we're going to go to jail

153
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,440
for a long, long time.

154
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,680
>> This is why it matters. Columbus has the

155
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,600
second largest Somalia population in the

156
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,479
country right behind Minnesota. So, in

157
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,120
this video, we're going to talk about

158
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,080
Ohio and people are asking the same

159
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,360
question. Is the same scam happening

160
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,400
again or is it possible it's even worse?

161
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,120
Let's get into it.

162
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,440
>> Is this an attack on immigrants?

163
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,240
>> This is an attack on fraud here in the

164
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,080
state of Ohio.

165
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,600
>> This Ohio lawmaker making some serious

166
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,680
demands on what he calls reports of

167
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,680
fraud within publicly funded daycarees

168
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,199
in Columbus. You can see that this place

169
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
is just a total dump.

170
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,520
>> More people are targeting Somali owned

171
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,639
daycarees looking for kids and

172
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,280
suggesting fraud. Would you call these

173
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,000
video clips allegations or would you

174
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,320
call them proof of fraud?

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,479
>> That's just an allegation of fraud.

176
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,720
>> Now, state rep. Josh Williams, who is

177
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,319
running for US Congress, sent this

178
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
letter to the Ohio Department of

179
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,199
Children and Youth, calling for more

180
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,160
unannounced inspections and attendance

181
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,720
audits of all publicly funded daycarees

182
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,759
in Ohio. He also wants to pull state and

183
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,479
federal funds on the suspicion of fraud

184
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,199
opposed to a charge or conviction.

185
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,080
>> We're saying the funds have to stop

186
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,919
until you prove that it is not fraud

187
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,400
moving forward. I mean, you go through

188
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,479
some of these inspection reports and you

189
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,039
do see non-compliance

190
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,240
when it comes to attendance. Are you

191
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,520
suggesting there is widespread fraud

192
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,319
within publicly funded daycare centers

193
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,039
in Columbus, especially those Somali

194
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,960
owned?

195
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,240
>> What we're alleging is that there is

196
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,240
widespread reporting of potential fraud

197
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,240
uh from individuals on the ground.

198
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,000
>> Columbus isn't random. It has thousands

199
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
of daycare centers, home health care

200
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,639
agencies, grocery stores, and nonprofits

201
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,960
tied to government funding. Most people

202
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,800
are just trying to survive. Most are not

203
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,039
doing anything wrong. But history shows

204
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,199
that a small group exploiting weak

205
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,360
oversight to steal millions and millions

206
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,840
of dollars. That is why people inside

207
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,240
Ohio are starting to speak up. They're

208
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,479
saying that this looks exactly like

209
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,720
Minnesota. Same behavior, same

210
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,240
resistance to questions, same money

211
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,840
streams. So these individuals tried to

212
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,680
report the fraud that was happening in

213
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,360
Ohio and then eventually came to me to

214
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,680
say that we're watching providers rubber

215
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,840
stamp paperwork for home health. So in

216
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,680
Ohio and there's many states like this

217
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,160
uh Pennsylvania and other states too

218
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,199
where you can go in and you can say my

219
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,440
aging parent needs a home health care

220
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,919
and I want to provide it. So the state

221
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,840
will as long as a doctor has approved it

222
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,160
continue to pay you. It could be for 10

223
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,240
hours, 12 hours, up to 24 when it's

224
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,319
critical care. So you could sit at home

225
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,800
without caring for an elderly parent who

226
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,960
really doesn't need it, make about $75

227
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
to $90,000 a year. Now you add two

228
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,520
parents, that's 180. Now you add your

229
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,120
in-laws, $ 250. You continue to add this

230
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,520
and you wonder what are the services

231
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,919
being provided. So a lot of providers

232
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,840
came and said fraud is occurring because

233
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,080
we said we weren't going to rubber stamp

234
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,160
this paperwork. So they went to other

235
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,360
providers, their home healthcare network

236
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,280
saying, "We'll make it worth your

237
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,680
while." Well, sounds like a kickback to

238
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,479
me. So, we really need to investigate

239
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,319
the Medicaid system and how much it's

240
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,319
increased since the Somalian population

241
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,159
came and who really needs critical care

242
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,719
cuz that's meant for our disabled, our

243
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,640
elderly, and people who really need it,

244
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,320
not to just live up our system. And

245
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,760
that's what's happening in Ohio. I think

246
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,760
it's ridiculous. I think it's

247
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,519
despicable. But authorities are now

248
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,200
looking at it from the attorney

249
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,519
general's office to the US attorney's

250
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,760
office. I flagged them all because this

251
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,120
is Ohio tax dollars and we have to take

252
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,480
it seriously. I'm tired of people

253
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,399
telling me, "Well, this is the way it's

254
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,240
always been. It's subjective and we

255
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,560
can't really check." No, you can't.

256
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,399
Audit America, audit Ohio now. And I'm

257
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,240
pushing for that in every single state.

258
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,240
>> Yeah, definitely. I think that there's

259
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,240
going to be or there needs to be more

260
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,000
invested in checking to see if everyone

261
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
is doing it right. Regardless of if

262
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,120
you're a Somalian or whatever, there's

263
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,480
tons of fraud happening across the

264
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,880
country. At least some of the Somalian

265
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,360
fraud that we've seen, it's so blatantly

266
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,800
obvious that they're it's fraud that

267
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
they're they're not even clever about

268
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,320
it. But at least the first selection of

269
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,560
fraud that you going to you can quickly

270
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,080
eliminate because they're just they're

271
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,920
doing it right in front of everyone's

272
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,680
face. They don't really care how it

273
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,279
looks. So, similar to Nick Shirley,

274
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,440
people are walking up to daycare during

275
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,600
business hours and they're asking a very

276
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,000
simple question. How do I enroll my

277
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
child? That said, no accusations, no

278
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,399
confrontation, but you can look at the

279
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,360
reaction.

280
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,160
>> Um, you know, how much does it cost?

281
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,160
>> Whoa.

282
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,200
>> You can't just grab myself.

283
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,040
>> The First Choice Childc Care LLC.

284
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,440
>> Look at this. Why is there

285
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,480
>> with a uh

286
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,320
Casim Brothers

287
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,920
semitr in the parking lot.

288
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,440
That's what you want to see uh when

289
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,399
you're dropping your kid off for child

290
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,399
care is a semitr.

291
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,040
See if we can. It's locked.

292
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,720
>> Yeah, which makes sense. I mean,

293
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,800
>> yeah, it should be locked. Yeah,

294
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,360
>> most daycarees I've been to, they are

295
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,519
locked.

296
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,920
>> Legally, they should be protect the

297
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,920
kids.

298
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,920
>> Yeah.

299
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,320
Lots of

300
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,600
security cameras. Notice the trend at

301
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:56,120
all these locations.

302
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,120
>> Camera up there. Camera over there.

303
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,680
>> There's no cars in the parking lot. So,

304
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,040
>> they're open 7 days a week though and

305
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,480
there's no signage to say

306
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,480
>> say it's closed. So there's

307
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,680
and then this is kind of the

308
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,760
neighborhood you're looking at

309
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,519
next door.

310
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,120
Oh, we have another daycare center right

311
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,920
next door.

312
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,839
>> Bright Futures.

313
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,839
So I guess we can just Oops.

314
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,680
They must have started putting these

315
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,560
cards in

316
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,560
>> fire property. No trespassing.

317
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,399
This one also has camera thing.

318
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,040
>> It's interesting that they boarded all

319
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,360
of this up too. So you can't

320
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,760
>> you can't see inside at all in any of

321
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,560
these

322
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,320
>> tons of daycarees um where at least this

323
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,920
is open so you can see

324
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,920
>> they have a nice lobby entry. Yeah.

325
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,160
>> Hi. Um I was wondering are you open

326
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,160
today?

327
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,720
Do you have any paperwork? I just wanted

328
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,720
to look up your enrollment for a

329
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,720
three-year-old.

330
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,959
My name is Nah.

331
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,959
Heat. Heat.

332
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,120
I'm sorry.

333
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,120
>> Am I what?

334
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,399
>> You're going to send somebody?

335
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,760
>> No.

336
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,600
>> Okay.

337
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,839
Okay. They want us to stop recording for

338
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,680
um for

339
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,040
>> Okay, that's fine.

340
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,320
>> Price after we fill the application.

341
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,320
>> So, how much does it cost?

342
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,639
>> I don't understand.

343
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,680
>> Just asking how how much it cost to go

344
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,839
to daycare here.

345
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,839
>> Thank you.

346
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,560
Is it?

347
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,440
>> Um, you know how much does it cost?

348
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,680
>> Whoa.

349
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,880
>> You can't just grab myself.

350
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,240
>> Like that's insane. Their hours are

351
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
Monday through Friday.

352
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,199
>> Say they should be open. And they

353
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,800
literally asked if I'm recording and

354
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,800
then pushed me. That's insane.

355
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,320
There's clearly children in there.

356
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,320
I just don't think you should put your

357
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,880
hands on somebody and push them out.

358
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,360
>> No.

359
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,160
>> Safe.

360
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,920
>> Yeah.

361
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,920
>> I'm just wondering why you're pushing

362
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,920
me.

363
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,800
No, the lady literally put her hands on

364
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,800
me and pushed me. I just had a couple

365
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,800
questions.

366
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,639
>> Well, if they did that, why did you call

367
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,000
the police?

368
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,519
>> I mean, I'm not going to call the

369
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,720
police. I'm just trying to ask a few

370
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,480
questions.

371
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,680
>> If they push you, you should have called

372
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,680
the police.

373
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,519
>> Okay, that's a good idea. I should call

374
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,320
the police. Okay, thank you so much.

375
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,760
Happy New Year.

376
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,480
>> This is a question. How do you enroll

377
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,360
How do you enroll your children here?

378
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,360
You can't do that.

379
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
No kids.

380
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,199
So, how how the how can I enroll my

381
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,199
children? It says you get you get public

382
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,440
money through

383
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,560
>> you get public money through Ohio. You

384
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,560
get money through the state of Ohio.

385
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,160
>> This is a this is a money that gets

386
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,920
matter.

387
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,360
>> They won't explain enrollment. They get

388
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,639
defensive. They get angry. They

389
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,240
physically push people out of the

390
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,399
building and that's not normal. Anyone

391
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,160
who has children, you call a daycare,

392
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,440
you call a school, they can't wait to

393
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,279
tell you all the information. They'll

394
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,120
schedule a tour. You come by, check the

395
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,600
place out. Most legit daycarees want

396
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,759
kids. They advertise. They explain the

397
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,000
pricing. They hand you the paperwork.

398
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,240
But here we see is locked doors, no

399
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,079
visible children, no clear enrollment

400
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,160
process, and a lot of aggressive

401
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,680
behavior. These are the same red flags

402
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,959
that we saw in Minnesota. Different

403
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,120
state, but the same playbook. Because

404
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,880
right now we see a pattern, and patterns

405
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,399
do matter. In Minnesota, investigators

406
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,639
found daycare billing for kids that

407
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,120
weren't there, payments tied to weak

408
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,720
verification systems, little real-time

409
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,639
oversight. Ohio seems like they're using

410
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,480
the same funding structures, and the

411
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,839
locals are saying you can't enroll your

412
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,279
kids, no one's going to answer your

413
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,120
door, auditors are going to get pushed

414
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,639
out, and the money just keeps flowing.

415
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,160
That's why people are asking questions,

416
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,639
not because of race, not because of

417
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480
politics, because this is taxpayer

418
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,959
money. This concern didn't come out of

419
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,199
nowhere. Ohio already has major SNAP and

420
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,800
food snap. Fraud cases, documented

421
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,880
cases, court records, millions of

422
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,040
dollars, grocery stores swapping

423
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,360
benefits for cash, inflated

424
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,959
transactions, fraud lasting years before

425
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,320
anyone steps in. Now, the governor is

426
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,920
not really taking this very seriously.

427
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,120
He says investigations are happening. He

428
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,199
says that people shouldn't jump to

429
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,799
conclusions based on viral videos. But

430
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,480
the critics are saying Minnesota said

431
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,400
the same thing. Oversight usually comes

432
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,600
in way too late. According to one

433
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,839
Midwestern Rhino Republican governor,

434
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,679
apparently fraud is just part of doing

435
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,000
business now. And that's the message

436
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,640
coming out of the Ohio governor's office

437
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,720
after questions about potential massive

438
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,199
fraud in his state. When asked about the

439
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,280
taxpayer funded daycare centers and the

440
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,679
fraud, the response, well, it wasn't

441
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,520
shock and it wasn't urgency. It was,

442
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,520
"This has been known for decades and

443
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,919
therefore it's just a cost of doing

444
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,919
business." That line alone right there

445
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,440
deserves a slap across the face from the

446
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,440
taxpayer. According to the governor

447
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,520
spokesperson, if you're surprised people

448
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,679
might defraud public daycare programs,

449
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,600
well, that's on you for being naive

450
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,919
because everyone knows that just happens

451
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,120
and everyone just has to live with it.

452
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,520
And meanwhile, Ohio spends over $800

453
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,160
million a year on childare assistance.

454
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,080
$800 million. That's almost $1 billion.

455
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,919
That's not monopoly money. That's your

456
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,760
paycheck. That's the taxes they take

457
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,799
from you every pay period. And here's

458
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,480
where this starts to get a little

459
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,880
uncomfortable. If fraud has been known

460
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,960
for decades, that means two things can't

461
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,480
be both true. Either the oversight is

462
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,320
failing or the fraud it's being

463
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,160
tolerated. Because calling something the

464
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,000
cost of doing business, that's not

465
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,520
accountability. It's turning a blind eye

466
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,039
to the fraud. And why would you do such

467
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,720
a thing? Maybe you're in on it. Now,

468
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,799
we're expected to budget and we're

469
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,559
expected to document every dollar and

470
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,400
you're expected to follow the rules. But

471
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,640
when millions, potentially billions,

472
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,480
disappear in public programs, we're told

473
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,400
that's just how it work. We've seen this

474
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,640
with the other governor, even the

475
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,799
Democratic governor, where they want to

476
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,200
always show that they have complete

477
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,360
control of what's going on. We got it.

478
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,039
We know there's fraud, but we're we're

479
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,799
on it. And that's not working for Tim

480
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,480
Walsh, obviously. And I guess with this

481
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,760
governor here, he's trying to do the

482
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,000
same thing. And that is terribly worded.

483
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,080
We shouldn't tolerate fraud. Yes, it

484
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,120
happens, but doesn't mean it needs to be

485
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,720
done to a point where potentially

486
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,240
hundreds of millions of dollars are

487
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,600
being missing. I don't think that's

488
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
something that we should tolerate. I

489
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,559
think that's something we should take

490
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,799
very seriously. We should be very angry

491
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,760
about it because a lot of people pay

492
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:17,600
into a system that's being, you know,

493
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,400
robbed. So that's the So I would say

494
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,320
that for that governor, his tone, for

495
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
that governor, that statement just seems

496
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,080
to be very out of touch. And now

497
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,640
lawmakers are calling for investigations

498
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,720
because similar ghost daycare schemes

499
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,960
have already blown up in other states,

500
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,559
which raises a very simple question if

501
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,120
this really is the cost of doing

502
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,880
business. Who exactly decided taxpayers

503
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,720
should be the ones paying it? Aggressive

504
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
behavior should trigger immediate

505
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,840
results because people are arguing that

506
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,480
leadership is more focused on keeping

507
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,200
Ohio's image clean than aggressively

508
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,919
exposing problems early. Now, this

509
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,240
governor is Republican governor. So we

510
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,240
see from Democrat governor in Minnesota

511
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,160
to the Republican governor in Ohio,

512
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,360
we're seeing the same issues. They're

513
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,840
not taking it seriously and they're

514
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,840
allowing people to commit fraud. We need

515
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,000
to continue to repeat this that every

516
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,080
dollar stolen is a child that doesn't

517
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,160
get real care, a family that loses

518
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,080
support, and a taxpayer getting robbed.

519
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,400
Minnesota obviously is not a one-off.

520
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,080
This might be just a warning. If Ohio

521
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,640
ignores the signs, this will just get

522
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,799
worse. And we must really take a look in

523
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,039
the entire country to see how far this

524
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,640
extent goes in terms of Medicaid fraud

525
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,559
and the daycare fraud and all this type

526
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,640
of fraud regardless of who is doing it

527
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,120
because the solution isn't hate, it's

528
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,440
audits, transparency, oversight.

529
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,200
Sunlight kills these scams and that's

530
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,799
why so many people are going after

531
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,320
they're going across the country. I've

532
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,760
heard that it's happening in

533
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,760
Massachusetts. We have to talk about

534
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,520
that as well. Let me know if you're in

535
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,280
Ohio. Have you seen this type of thing

536
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,159
happening? Let me know all your thoughts

537
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,159
in the comments below.
