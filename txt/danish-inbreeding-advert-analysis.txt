 I watched this video, didn't understand it cuz it's in Danish. Then I found a copy of it with English subtitles and then obviously understood it, understood what they were saying. Before that, when I watched the Danish version of it, it was rumored that it might be satire. And when I watched it, I was like, "Got to be. It has to be satire." when I watched it with the English subs, but it turns out there's still a bit of a debate, but it turns out it's not. This is a real advert in Denmark. Fore you are. So if if you're reading along there, if of course you don't speak Danish, if you were reading along there, then it it's basically uh an advert about inbreeding. And whoever that dude is, he's telling this couple here, who are of course both white and I'm assuming both Danish, that for the Danes to have survived previously, they mated outside of themselves um to make sure that uh they weren't disease ridden or what have you. Now, as you might have gathered, it's picked up quite the attention and uh opinion and comment um online. Um now I'm an expert. I'm not a biologist or a Billy G type expert. Um, if you are watching this outside of Europe, like the US for example, all the rumors that you're hearing are true. If you're in Europe and have the pleasure of residing there like myself here in the UK, England, um then you'll be experiencing it firsthand because one of the talking points that this has brought about is the idea that there may be some sort of agenda going on and it's becoming more and more evident by the day. I'll allow you guys because as as I said I I live here in the UK and England and all the rumors about the knocks at the door um for social media posts are true as well. So, I'll allow you guys to speculate among yourselves and uh and offer feedback to this marvelous little movie that you just saw there advert. Um because uh well, I can't speak I can't I can't speak. Um but uh interesting stuff, huh? Is there an agenda? Tata.
