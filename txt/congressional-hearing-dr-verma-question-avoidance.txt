 A clip like this is a career ender. Dr. Verma gets exposed in front of the entire nation on live television in front of Congress. >> Dr. Verma, I wasn't sure I understood your answer to Senator Moody a moment ago. Do Do you think that men can get pregnant? >> Keep in mind, this is a doctor. Watch how she dances around this. >> I hesitated there because I wasn't sure where the conversation was going or what the goal was. >> Acting confused. I wasn't sure where you're going with that. If we cannot define these terms, we cannot begin to approach policy. >> I mean, I do take care of patients with different identities. I take care of many women. I take care of people with different identities. Um, and so that's where I paused, I think. Um, yeah, I wasn't sure where you were going with that. >> Well, the the goal is the truth. >> So, she still hasn't answered the question. She's just stalling for time. All he has to do is repeat the question. >> So, can men get pregnant? Again, the reason I paused there is I I'm not really sure what the goal of the question. >> The goal is just to establish a biological reality. >> He repeats the question, she repeats the same tactic. Again, I'm still I'm still not sure where you're going with this, so I can't begin to answer it. >> You just said a moment ago that science and evidence should control, not politics. >> So, let's just test that proposition. Can men get pregnant? >> I take care of people with many identities. >> But that's not the question he's asking you. She's not asking you who you take care of, >> but um can men get pregnant? >> There are many women that can get pregnant. I do take care of people that don't identify as women that >> can can men get pregnant. >> Again, as I'm saying, >> let me just let me just remind you what you testified to a moment ago. >> Then he makes the smartest move by showing why this is important and why he's asking the question. Now, she can't claim, well, I was confused about where you were going with this, so I couldn't begin to answer it. Well, now you know. >> Science and evidence should control, not politics. >> So, should can men get pregnant? >> You're a doctor. >> Science and evidence should guide medicine. >> Okay, then why can't we acknowledge science and evidence? >> I >> do. Science and evidence tell us that men can get pregnant. Biological men, can they get pregnant? >> I also think yes no questions like this are a political tool. >> No. Yes questions are about the truth, doctor. >> And this is the second tactic you're going to see. Well, you're just utilizing this. This question is not being asked in good faith. You're just utilizing this to accomplish a political goal. This is important because the same pattern plays out in so many debates. >> We have to have policies some that establish some definition of this. Do you want to answer the question, what is a woman, Jack? >> I think that question is supposed to be used to deflect from an actual conversation. I think answering it gives credibility to a conversation that does not deserve it. >> You don't actually even care. you're just obsessed with trans people. In the next video I make, we're going to look at the same pattern play out with content creators debating on YouTube and the exact same pattern is going to occur and it looks just as ridiculous no matter which level you're at. >> Let's not make a mockery of this proceeding. This is about science and evidence and I'm asking you, you know, the United States Supreme Court just heard arguments yesterday at great length on this question. This is not a hypothetical question. This is not theoretical. It affects real people in their real lives. And you're here as an expert called by the other side as an expert and you've been telling us that you that you follow right you're a doctor and you follow the science and the evidence. So I just want to know based on the science can men get pregnant. >> That's a yes or no question. It really is. I think >> I think you're trying to reduce the complexity of a lot. >> I'm not I'm trying to get it's not complex. I don't know why she doesn't take the easy out with the progressive response of well yes humans who are born biologically male cannot get pregnant but they can express their gender or change their identity. There's ways she could have answered this by that would still acknowledge the scientific literature. Instead she chooses this tap dancing routine. >> I'm trying to get to an answer and I'm trying to test frankly your veracity as a medical professional and as a scientist. Can men get pregnant? >> I think you're also conflating this extraordinary male. >> When is the last time you woke up actually feeling rested? Maybe you're feeling a lack of energy, lack of drive, zero motivation, or struggles with gut health. If so, you're not alone. And it's probably not that you're just getting older. Bloss was built for men who are tired of feeling like a shadow of who they used to be and want to actually do something about it. That dad bod, the brain fog, the fact that you'd rather sleep than spend time with your wife. These aren't character flaws. There's symptoms and they're usually tied directly to your hormones. Every Blok's Lab includes a 30 to 60 minute consultation with a licensed clinician who connects what you're feeling to what's actually happening in your body and builds you a real plan to fix it.

What you were talking about is biolog biological males. Um, >> this isn't hard, doctor. Can men get pregnant? Yes or no? >> I would be more than happy to have a conversation with you that is not coming from a place of trying to be polarized. >> You can't mind read. You can't tell me what my motivations are or where it's what place it's coming from, what I'm trying to accomplish at this point. It's so ridiculous. like there is cause for concern here. >> I'm not trying to be polarizing. I'm trying to ask I I think it is extraordinary that we are here in hearing about science and about women. And for the record, it's women who get pregnant, not men. >> It also >> we are here about the safety of women and science that shows that this abortion drug causes adverse health events. For context, the concern is around men being able to purchase these abortion drugs with the potential of abusing them. And >> as states are trying after DOBS to come up with as a people what their laws are going to be, we here in Washington have to make sure that those laws that they come up with to prevent this kind of thing to protect their people are not circumvented. Miss Verma, can men get pregnant? Um, Dr. Verma, I just want to make sure we're >> Dr. Verma, can men get pregnant? As a doctor, give me your opinion. As a doctor, can men get pregnant? >> Um, I mean, I'll move on to the next one. >> But we cannot even begin to have that conversation if we can't clarify what men are. >> And yet, you won't even acknowledge the basic reality that biological men don't get pregnant. There's a difference between biological men and biological women. I I just I don't know how we can take you seriously and your claims to be a a person of science if you won't level with us on this basic issue. I thought we were past all of this, frankly. But for many, this will never be behind us. I I I can't believe we're still here talking about this. >> I am a person of science and I'm also someone here who's here to represent the complex experiences of my patients. >> Why are you here to represent the complex experiences of your patients? And I don't think polarized languages language or questions serve that goal. I don't think they serve the American people. >> It is not polarizing to say that there is a scientific difference between men and women. And I want this to be clear and for the record. It is not polarizing to say that women are a biological reality and should be treated and protected as such. That is not polarizing. That is truth. It is also, by the way, the United States Constitution, which offers unique protections to women in a variety of circumstances as women. And your refusal to recognize women as women and men as men, is deeply corrosive to science, to public trust, and yes, to constitutional protections for women as women. And I just I I I think it's extraordinary that you would sit here in advance a political agenda that has been thoroughly discredited and rejected by the American people in this forum. And I I'm glad we had this exchange because it is exceptionally clarifying. It is also in many ways quite depressing. >> I mean it's so nonsensical at this point. It's comical. This is probably the worst performance I have ever seen of anyone asked this
