 Bitcoin just did something absolutely insane. On Sunday night, Bitcoin pumped $3,000, ripped through 90K, and liquidated 103 million in shorts. And then Monday morning, Bitcoin dumped 2,700 and wiped out 40 million in longs and erased the entire move. Same price, different victims. Total chaos. Good morning. Say it back. GFY. And I hope you all had a merry Christmas because yeah, 2025 sucked. But what if I told you what if gold and silver ripping right now isn't bad news for Bitcoin at all? What if it's the exact signal we've seen before? Every historic Bitcoin run. Because every time gold outperforms Bitcoin for a year, the same crowd crawls back out of the woodwork. Bitcoin's dead. Digital gold failed. This time's different. All right, so let's look at the receipts. Trailing returns. One year gold plus 70%. Bitcoin down 12%. Go ahead and cue the victory lap. But now zoom out. 3 years gold up 146%, Bitcoin up 418%. Read them and weep. And yes, Peter Schiff, this is for you. The question isn't why gold is winning now. The question is why Bitcoin is down 30% from its peak while gold and silver are going parabolic. And the answer because this is how it starts. Gold and silver move first. Bitcoin moves last. And when it moves, it doesn't ask for permission. After the March 2020 crash, the Fed injected massive liquidity. Gold ran from 1450 to 2000. Silver went from $12 to nearly 30. Bitcoin did nothing for five months. Bitcoin went sideways. Then gold topped. Silver stalled. Liquidity rotated. And Bitcoin went from 12,000 to 64,800 cut bucks. Iron Mike said it best. Everybody has a plan till they get punched in the mouth. Now look at today. Gold near 4550. Silver near 80 bucks. Bitcoin chopping sideways again. Same movie, new cast, more fuel. And this time something just broke. A systemically important bank blew up in the silver futures market. They failed a margin call. The exchange liquidated them and the Fed rushed in with 34 billion overnight on top of 17 billion just days earlier just to stop the system from snapping. Translation for the normies, they bet silver wouldn't rise. Silver ripped. They couldn't pay. The House forced liquidations. The Fed hit the panic button. Silver doesn't move like this unless something breaks and something just did. Bitcoin's revenge is imminent and 9 million Bitcoin is on the table. We have a massive show today, Sunday. [music] >> It is officially over. For years, we have sat here and speculated. We have looked at the charts. We have looked at the open interest and we have guessed. We have said, "One day the banks will break." We have said, "One day the naked shorts will get caught offside." so badly that the entire financial system will have to bend the knee. We have hypothesized that the bullion banks are leveraged to the hilt playing a dangerous game of fractional reserve paper trading against a physical asset that is running out. But up until this morning, that was just a theory. It was a mathematical probability, sure, but we didn't have the smoking gun. We didn't have the body. Well, stop guessing. Stop speculating because that day is today. The body has been found. Ladies and gentlemen, Asian guy here. While you were glued to your screens watching the spot price of silver hit $77.16, while you were celebrating the breakout and calculating your net worth, something much more important, much darker, and much more terrifying was happening in the plumbing of the global financial system. Something that the mainstream media is terrified to report because it proves without a shadow of a doubt that the banking system is insolvent. We just received the official data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York regarding their overnight reverse repurchase agreements, the repo facility for this morning, Friday, December 26th. And the number that just flashed across the terminal is not a typo. It is not an error. It is a confession. 17 billion $251 million. In a single morning, in the quiet hours just after the Christmas holiday, the two big to fail banks tapped the Federal Reserve's emergency liquidity window for over 17 billion in cash. Now, you need to understand what this means. You need to understand what the repo market actually is. This is not the window where healthy banks go to get a loan to expand their business. This is not where you go to get capital for a new project. The repo facility is the pawn shop of the last resort. It is the emergency room for a heart attack. If you are a healthy bank with a balanced book, you do not touch the repo facility. You trade in the interbank market. You borrow from your peers. It is a badge of honor to avoid the Fed's window because going there is a signal of weakness. It is the walk of shame of the banking world. So why would the masters of the universe, the entities that supposedly control the global economy, need 17 billion in cash at 8:00 a.m. on the day after Christmas? Is it for payroll? No. Is it for operational expenses? No. They need it because they are bleeding to death. They need it because they just received the biggest margin call in the history of the commodities markets. Connect the dots. Look at the timing. It is impeccable. Yesterday, silver gapped up. Overnight, it teleported to $77. The banks are sitting on short positions that number in the hundreds of millions of ounces. They sold those contracts at $30. They sold them at $50. They sold them at $70, thinking they could tamp it down like they always do. They thought they could spook the retail investors, trigger the stops, and buy it back cheaper. But the retail investors didn't sell. The Chinese industrial buyers didn't sell. The vaults were empty. The price didn't go down. It went vertical. And right now, silver is trading at $77.16. Do the math. Every single dollar that silver rises creates billions of dollars in losses on their books. But there is a difference between unrealized losses and a margin call. For months, the banks have been hiding these losses. They mark them as unrealized. They pretend that the price will come back down so they don't have to acknowledge the hole in their balance sheet. They kick the can down the road. But the comics clearing house doesn't care about your accounting tricks. The exchange doesn't care if you think the price will go down next week. The exchange cares about solveny right now. When the price moves $5 against you in 24 hours, the clearing house computer spits out a number. It says, "You're underwater. Post the cash to cover the risk or we liquidate your position." This morning, that computer spat out a number, and that number was evidently $17 billion. The clearing house called the banks and said, "Pay up." And the banks looked at their ledgers, looked at their liquid cash reserves, and realized the terrifying truth. They didn't have it. They are illquid. They are insolvent on a marktomarket basis. While everyone was watching silver rip to 79 bucks, the real story hit the plumbing. Banks quietly tapped 17 billion from the New York Fed repo window right after Christmas. Holiday week, overnight money, full allotment. And here's the key detail no one is talking about. 85% of the collateral was mortgagebacked securities, not treasuries, not gold standard collateral. The junk drawer. So, let me explain this like a pawn shop. Imagine a guy who owns a mansion, but instead of borrowing against the house, he walks into a pawn shop with a busted TV and old jewelry asking for overnight cash. That's the banking system right now. They didn't want to pawn the good stuff. They pawned the scraps. And this is why the the signal isn't price anymore. It's availability. When paper starts shaking, banks run to the Fed. Exchanges change the rules. physical disconnects from paper and price discovery moves east rapidly. That's why silver ripped. That's why gold ripped and that's why everything is moving at once. Gold, silver, copper, platinum, platium, oil. This doesn't happen in healthy systems. In normal expansions, commodities move independently. When they all move together, that's capital fleeing paper. We've seen this movie before. 2000 before the.com collapse, 2007 before the financial crisis, and 2019 during repo stress. Every time commodities sniff out the problem first. The stress signal is already here, and most people are just aren't looking in the right place. Now, here is where it gets a little uncomfortable for the bears. A new research paper says Bitcoin could surge 500% following gold's new highs. And before all the fact checkers foam at the mouth, yes, correlations change, but history still matters. In 2020, gold topped in August. Bitcoin went from 11,000 to 69K, nearly 500%. And this time, we have more catalysts than ever. Liquidity injections already restarted. Rate cuts are coming. SLR exemptions may return. Crypto regulation is clearing. More ETFs are coming. Asset managers have full access. And we have a pro- crypto fed chair knock knocking on Satoshi's door. And the markets like to frontr run policy. Last cycle was liquidity only. This cycle is liquidity plus structure. Same setup, more fuel. But before we go deeper, and yes, there's an even more bullish historical precedent. And we also have to discuss how we got here in the first place. But before we do, look at our likes. >> Three or four times, maybe. >> I got to pump those numbers up.

And I want to ask you the following question about Bitcoin. And I'm going to channel our buddies. Okay. We have some other big crypto whales, Bitcoin whales. I I feel like Bitcoin every time it gets a bid, Michael, it gets slammed to the mat. Okay. You're a wrestler, right? Every time every time you feel like you're going to win a point in a wrestling match, uh the opponent to Bitcoin flips it to the ground and starts the pinning process. what what do you what do you say to that? So there's a great book that your speculative, you know, listeners, you know, the traders out there should read called the hour between the dog and the wolf. And he talked about the psychology of a bull market, which is all testosterone fed and the psychology of a bare market where it's it's cortisol. And he said in a bull market you see guys sitting around the trading floor talking about women, talking about cars, all pumped up. What about their their lift? In a bare market, what happens is the market falls, it starts coming back. Oh, thank goodness. Ah, thank goodness. And even though you would promise yourself you were going to cut some of your risk if it came back, you now are have endorphins pumping into your body and you're like, it's good. I can do it tomorrow. You go on a walk and it rolls right back over and you go back into fight or flight. And so he says in a bare market traders get these little look like beer bellies, right? cortisol bellies and their hands are on their hips and all the guys start slunching their whole their shoulders a little bit. You know, that's the market we've been in in crypto for the last, you know, three months. Uh, every time it feels like it's going up, yeah, you breathe a sigh of relief and then you get punched. >> So, but what is it, Michael? Is it whale selling? Is it is it >> I think we under we underestimated the damage of Black Friday, the the flash crash October 9th. uh it was a psychologically damaging and liquidity damaging thing for retail and crypto at its prime you know the primary user of of crypto has always been retail certainly we've got a lot of institutions in Bitcoin and more Ethereum and Salana but that process really beat up rip retail and all investors are momentum based right like growth stocks and crypto or momentum based instruments. Um, and so we haven't had enough juice to get the narrative going again. And I think you're going to go in this kind of choppy, sideways, less liquid range until we take out a 100. And it's not going to be easy to take out. You're going to need new money coming in. A lot of the guys have burned. There's sellers of calls above. So, a lot of the big holders say, "Well, I'll sell calls to make some income. Uh that works until it doesn't. It works until V gets so low and then there's a catalytic event. Asset becomes the Fed governor and pushes up much faster. Pays a rate cuts. Uh the budget keeps blowing out, right? Uh >> our our old boss Lloyd Blankfine, you said, "Be careful picking pennies up in front of a steamroller." Remember that expression? >> I just read Lloyd's uh biography on the flight over. So shout out Lloyd Blankfine. It read like it's the first book I've read in a while in one sitting. >> Let's talk psychology. People who own Bitcoin are watching silver outperform them by 160% this year. That messes with your head. And that's why Bitcoin can't hold a bounce. Every rally gets sold. Every breakout gets faded. Mooch nailed it. In bare phases. Bounces feel like relief, not opportunity. Retail got smoked in October. Liquidity dried up. Confidence cracked. Big holders sell calls. Volatility compresses. markets coil until they don't. This isn't a broken market. It's an exhausted one. And exhausted markets don't move slowly forever, they snap. Now, let's get to how we got here. The real history that tells us where we're headed. December 23rd, 1913, the Federal Reserve Act is signed. Since then, the dollar lost 97% of its purchasing power. Because here's the truth no one wants to say out loud. Crises don't cause the intervention. They justify it. The system cracks. Then comes the cover story. World War I broke the gold standard. World War II fused fiscal and monetary power. Vietnam broke Britain Woods. 9/11 justified zero rates and asset bubbles. Co unleashed unlimited QE every time the same sequence. Fragility event liquidity flood. And now like FDR, just take a look around. Consumers are tapped. Credit delinquencies are exploding. Student loan garnishments have resumed. Housing is frozen. Commercial real estate is collapsing. Banks are stressed. Treasury refinancing looms. The system is already breaking. It just hasn't found its excuse yet. And history says when the excuse arrives, the money printer doesn't whisper, it roars. And here's the part Peter Schiff doesn't want you to see. Coming out of the global financial crisis, gold rose 200% from 2008 to 2011. Then gold fell nearly 50% and Bitcoin, Bitcoin went up 60,000%. Read that again. 60,000%. Apply that move to Bitcoin's 15K bottom, you get $9 million Bitcoin. Those are numbers that tell a very uncomfortable truth. They can argue narratives. They can argue timing. They can argue correlations, but they can't argue history. Gold and silver moving first isn't bearish. It's the warning shot. The storm always comes after the calm, and this calm feels awfully familiar. Hey, let us know what you think below and batten down the hatches. 2026 is going to be nuts.
