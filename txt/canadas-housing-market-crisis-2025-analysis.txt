 The Canadian economy, already contending with inflation, tariffs, and a cost of living crisis, is also watching a steady and ongoing slump in the housing market. >> These are some wild numbers, aren't they? Wild, wild numbers. Wow. >> I am afraid not to be able to uh cover my mortgage and my uh living expenses. >> Canada's housing market is unraveling fast. And Canada is in chaos as the housing market crash evolves into something no longer clickbait. It's now the reality Canadians are living with every day. Thousands of people are being added to the country daily. Yet, we're told to applaud a few hundred housing units as if that solves the problem. And somehow leadership still seems surprised when pouring gasoline on a fire leads to an explosion. >> CTV's Adrien Gobriel now on what's going on and where the market could be headed. Adrien. >> Sandy. Real estate associations are calling 2025 one for the history books for all the wrong reasons. If you're trying to sell a home, >> let's be honest with ourselves for a moment because the situation Canada is in right now doesn't require exaggeration. It's already extreme. Canada's housing market isn't just overheated anymore. It is unstable, distorted, and dangerously disconnected from reality. And what makes this moment different from past housing scares is that this crisis isn't driven by speculation alone. It's being structurally reinforced by government policy at every level. This didn't happen overnight. It didn't happen because of one bad year or one bad decision. Wild and worrisome. >> Imagine how many more people there are here now than there were 25 years ago. Yeah, these are spectacularly low numbers. You have to go back to the year 2000 to find Toronto home sales lower than they are right now. In 2021, sales peaked at more than 127,000. Last year, that number plummeted to roughly 62,000, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. >> It happened because for years, Canada was on the assumption that population growth could substitute for real economic growth and that housing would somehow magically absorb the pressure. It didn't. Let's start with the basic imbalance that nobody in power wants to confront. Honestly, Canada is adding people at a scale that completely overwhelms its housing system. When you combine permanent immigration, temporary foreign workers, international students, and asylum claimants, the net number of people staying in the country every year is enormous. >> Thousands of condos are left unsold. The Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation says about 2500 new condos are sitting empty in Metro Vancouver. That's double what it was last year. And in Toronto, the CMHC says the weakening condo market appears to have similarities to the crash of the early9s. Escalating costs from material and labor are some of the factors behind this market stall. Even using conservative assumptions, thousands of people are added every single day who need housing immediately. Now, just compare that to housing construction. Canada builds roughly 200,000 to 275,000 homes per year in good conditions. That number already assumes everything goes right. Financing, labor, approvals, materials. When you break that down, it's a few hundred homes across the entire country. That gap between demand and supply is not a policy debate. It's a structural failure. And yet, instead of slowing demand to match supply, government messaging celebrates tiny housing announcements as major wins. >> And at the same time, we see a decline in mortgage rates. So, people's affordability improves. Then you would see a return of the buyers in a larger number than um and they would be buying more. Right now, it's a buyer market. there's a lot more supply out there and people who are looking for deals, this is a good time to to to enter the market. >> You know, when we look at some of the the comments from Canada's mortgage and housing corporation and they say that the Toronto region has some parallels, what we're seeing in the condo market there has some parallels to the crash of the early 1990s. What are some of those parallels and might it end differently? >> 200 units here, 300 units there. These numbers sound impressive in isolation, but they collapse the moment you compare them with the scale of inflows. It's not progress, it's optics. What makes this worse is that many of these new housing projects aren't even new builds. They're conversions. Former nursing homes, old buildings repurposed. While that may help at the margins, it does nothing to change the fundamentals. Canadians aren't getting ahead. They're being reshuffled. At the same time, policymakers are floating the idea of reopening Canada's housing market to foreign capital. >> And now if you move forward, what we see today, that slowdown in the markets is essentially a result of economic instability brought about by the tariffs and on again offagain tariffs. So there are parallels and the parallels are that you have a large inventory of unsold product um and and and a moderate demand. But the those parallels end there. The reasons for why markets are slow now are quite different from the reasons before. >> That alone tells you how detached leadership has become from the lived experience of average Canadians. When people can't afford homes, inviting more global money into the same constrained market doesn't increase affordability. It locks it out permanently. We've already seen this play out. Cities like Vancouver and Toronto became unaffordable, not because Canadians suddenly got rich, but because housing was transformed into a financial asset class. Once that happens, governments become terrified of prices falling. Because falling prices exposes just how fragile the system really is. So instead of fixing the problem, they just try to sustain it. >> So the the the thing is that you you have to realize that when housing prices go down, buyers walk away from the markets. They don't come to the market when prices are falling. Buyers return when prices are rising. And that's just human nature. You don't want to buy an an asset that's losing value. So going forward, if you're looking at what are the determinants, I think as the sooner we get a deal with the United States um on on trade, um the economic certainty will return and as economic certainty will return and and the mortgage rates continue to decline and then there will be greater confidence amongst the buyers. Right now, people are just sitting on the fence looking at the the job market, looking at the economic uncertainty, looking at the mortgage rates. >> And that's where the trust collapses. When Canadians see policies that inflate housing values while wages stagnate, they don't need conspiracy theories to feel the system is rigged. Asset owners win, renters lose, young people lose, newcomers struggle, too. The only people consistently protected are those already inside the market. Now let's talk about population growth because this is the ideological backbone of everything happening. The argument pushed by influential figures is that Canada must grow its population aggressively or risk economic decline. Aging demographics >> decline in the near future and hence they are they are withholding their purchase. They are thinking that as rates go down even further then they will enter the market maybe later in the year. So the April May market for 2026 all else being equal looks brighter than what we are seeing today. >> So that was sort of my final question or leads into my final question on the forecast. You know when we're talking about next spring that's one thing to look ahead to. Do you think there will be more certainty once a trade deal has been reached and what sort of certainty or stability to the housing market could that bring? A lot rests right now on the the lack of certainty in the market. So the the sooner we get to it, the the sooner we are able to have a definitive deal so that we can start planning our economy and we can start determining what we are going to export. Falling birth rates, fewer workers supporting social programs. On paper, it all sounds reasonable. But reality tells a different story. Canada's population has surged, yet productivity has barely moved. GDP per capita has stagnated. Healthc care access is worse. Housing affordability has collapsed. Infrastructure is stretched thin. This is not the result of undergrowth. It's the result of unmanaged growth. Growth without capacity doesn't strengthen a country. It weakens it. Instead of investing in productivity, innovation, and wages, Canada has leaned on population increases to prop up headline GDP numbers. >> And you're seeing inventory levels rise. Renters now had more negotiating power. >> That negotiating power is because the number of active rental listings has reached near record highs. >> We're seeing landlords run a deficit every single month. Being a landlord is isn't something that I'm planning on on doing for too much longer. It's something everyone is getting out of. >> But GDP growth that doesn't improve living standards is meaningless to ordinary people. You can't live in a statistic. And here's the part that never gets addressed honestly. Speed matters. Immigration is not inherently the issue. Scale without preparation really is. You can't bring people faster here than you can house them, educate them, employ them, and provide health care for them. Doing so doesn't make Canada more compassionate. It just makes it dysfunctional. This is no longer theoretical. We're seeing the consequences in real time. Emergency rooms are overcrowded. Schools are bursting. High immigration is what fueled the high rent prices in the first place. In July 2024, international migration peaked at over a million people in a year. But now, especially with a new cap on international students, fewer people need rentals and it impacted the GTA most, the lowest rent growth in the country. Transit systems are overwhelmed, rental markets are brutal, and instead of acknowledging capacity limits, leadership insists the system can stretch indefinitely. It can't. Every system has a breaking point. And when systems are overwhelmed, standards drop. Vetting weakens. Enforcement becomes inconsistent. Credentialed verification becomes rushed. This isn't an accusation. It's operational reality. No institution functions optimally when volume exceeds oversight. What makes meaningful discussions nearly impossible is that any criticism of this approach is immediately framed as moral failure rather than policy disagreement. If you bought it more recently in the last five or six years, you could have a financial hardship, but it's very much a crisis. You have to take action. You just can't keep losing money. It can really only get worse. That shuts down rational debate. You can support immigration and still demand responsible pacing. In fact, failing to do so harms newcomers most of all. So, let's talk about the young Canadians because they are the clearest indicator that something has gone deeply wrong. This is the first generation in modern Canadian history that is openly worse off than their parents. Not because they lack ambition or work ethic, but because housing costs have become completely detached from income. Professionals with stable jobs, they can't buy homes in cities who where those jobs even exist. How much worse can it get? It's possible that so few people will be able to close that they won't be able to start the condominium corporation and they've got to tell their bank that they don't know how they can pay them back. It could be that bad. Families delay children because they can't afford space. Graduates live with roommates indefinitely and many are planning to leave, not because they hate Canada, because they don't see a future here. When a country educates its young people only to watch them immigrate for affordability and opportunity, that's not growth. That's literally failure. Meanwhile, governments ask these same young people to accept permanent procarity as the new normal. Rent forever, lower expectations, be grateful. That's not a vision. That's just surrendering. So, let's talk about the housing market itself because that is where things get dangerous >> this year. I mean tariffs was probably the word of the year for Canadians. What kind of an impact did that have on the housing market? >> Our research showed it was the single biggest drag on uh housing activity. The um interest rates moved from being a a barrier to entry to being either neutral or even supportive. Employment was uh stronger than we anticipated. >> A market built on perpetual demand growth, high leverage, and speculation is fragile. Prices can't rise faster than incomes forever. Debt can't expand indefinitely. At some point, something breaks. Either affordability improves or the market corrects. That's why talk of a housing crash is growing louder. Not because people want it, but because the system is brittle. Rising interest rates, job losses, or reduced inflows could shift sentiment fast. And the longer governments try to prop things up artificially, the harsher the eventual adjustment becomes. Here's the uncomfortable truth that policymakers avoid. Prices likely need to come down. And this is a power of sale. Once again, the bank has took over this 48% loss on this house. Then it finally sold. The bank took it. Obviously, we've been over this power of sales just trending up and up and up. >> Not collapse chaotically, but normalize. A healthy housing market is boring. It tracks incomes. It allows people to plan lives. What Canada now has anything but healthy. Of course, normalization scarce leadership because housing has become the backbone of the economy. But protecting inflated asset values at the expense of social stability is not leadership. That's avoidance. Technology is often presented as the savior. Modular housing, automation, AIdriven construction. These tools help, but they don't change the fundamentals. >> This is Ontario 1990 and this is US 2007. So, as you can see, we are 4 years into a bare market now. So, a lot of people out there saying this is just the beginning, right? Well, it's not. It's four years into a bare market. Even with innovation, you can't outbuild runaway demand in the short term. Technology supports policy. It can't replace it. Real solutions require restraint. That means aligning population growth with actual housing completions, not projections or promises. It means prioritizing housing for living, not speculation. It means restricting corporate or institutional ownership of residential property. And it means acknowledging that foreign capital has no role in fixing domestic affordability. Most importantly, it means restoring trust. A country cannot function when its citizens believe the system is stacked against them. And to add to that, just because I say that you should be prepared to be down on your housing purchase doesn't mean that that isn't the case at any other time in history. Think about all the people who bought real estate in like 2021 who at one point were up 10% on this purchase, 15% on this purchase, and now they're down 10% or they're down 15%. Housing is not just an asset. It is the foundation of social stability. When people can't afford shelter, everything else fractures. Family formation, mental health, productivity, and cohesion. Canada doesn't need to be bigger at any cost. It needs to be livable. Until leadership admits that growth without capacity is chaos, the housing crisis won't ease, it will deepen. And the longer this continues, the damage won't be temporary. It will define a generation. That's why this moment matters. Because this isn't just a housing market problem anymore. It's a national reckoning. Just because the market looks good or feels safe or is better than right now doesn't mean that you shouldn't have the exact same mindset going into that purchase. That if you are down on this purchase, you don't care because you're not selling it anytime soon. And this is why Canadians are no longer just frustrated when they're disengaging. When people stop believing that hard work leads to stability. When they stop believing that policies are designed with their future in mind, they don't just complain online, they withdraw. They delay families, abandon long-term plans, and mentally check out of the social contract. A country can survive bad years, but it cannot survive a generation that loses faith in the idea that tomorrow will be better than today. And in fact, as the market goes down and gets cheaper, there is a lesser probability that you are going to be down on that investment. When you buy into an asset that has just ran up 25%. There's a higher probability that at some point you're going to be down on that investment or you're going to probably be down for a longer period of time. But if you're buying an asset that's already come off 25% and everybody hates that asset, a lot of that risk of being down substantially on the investment is already taken out of the equation. Right? So if Canada wants to pull out of the chaos, it has to choose reality over narrative. That means admitting limits, slowing what needs to be slowed, fixing what's broken before scaling what's ambitious, and putting citizens back at the center of decision-making. Because housing isn't just about markets or margins. It's about whether people can build lives. And right now, that promise is slipping away.
