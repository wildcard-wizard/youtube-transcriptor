1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,080
It's a point that can feel at once

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,240
entirely benile and wholly offensive. We

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,480
either know it already or may wse at

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
such an overly direct mention.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,000
High-minded people can be especially

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,920
perturbed and have been since the

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,640
dialogues of Plato in the sermons of St.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,400
Paul. True love is about connection at

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,720
the highest levels. It's about shared

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,560
interests, compatible world views, and

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,800
alignment on politics and the ends of

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,880
life. We do have bodies naturally and

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,680
certain urges along with them, but they

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,880
do not and must not dominate the choices

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,680
of the wise, except of course that in

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,920
the clearest terms they should, for we

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,399
are never more benile and obtuse than

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,039
when we refuse to give low priorities

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,760
their due. We eat, we fart, we burp, and

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,239
to put it very gently, we need to make

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,360
love. And we need to succeed at

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,719
relationships to do it very winningly at

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,000
the level of ideas rather than

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,239
performance and rather often in order to

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,559
feel close, in order to feel acceptable

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,960
to ourselves, in order to reconnect with

27
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,040
our bodies, in order to feel welcomed by

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,439
our partner, in order to ease the

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,200
tensions of having large complex minds

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,240
that believe they know more than they

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,880
do. For all of these reasons, we need to

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,560
make love. Yet, how often, and

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,720
especially in the priorities of the

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,600
so-called intelligent, is this need

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,280
either relegated or ignored? There are

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,840
so many other considerations when we

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,600
meet someone new. Have they read Toltoy

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,360
or Kavafi? Would they get on with our

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
sister? Do they like Bob Dylan? Would

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,040
our friends like them? Are they as tidy

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,920
or as messy as we are? What do they

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,479
earn? How tall are they? What can easily

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,479
get lost is a much more fundamental

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,560
question. How good is the sex? And here

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,600
we need to admit there are vast

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,520
variations. Sex is not one thing, though

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,000
it takes a lot of luck or experience to

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,719
realize this may be the case. We need

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,799
once in our lives to have really enjoyed

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,520
superlative sex in order to have a

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,960
benchmark by which to measure its varied

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,840
instances. There are ecstatic, passable,

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,160
and very forgettable sorts. There's the

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,400
kind of sex that unfolds when the same

55
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,879
fantasies excite us. When the same

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,200
traumas were sublimated into kinks, when

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,680
compatible childhood wounds generate

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,879
erotic currents, when we too want very

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,959
much to do that thing with the

60
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,280
blindfold, the Kashmir jumper, or the

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,959
stripey socks. We too want to think

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
about the glances in the restaurant, the

63
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,280
caresses underwater, or the quiet

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,319
tension in the library stacks. There is

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,160
either alignment or there isn't. far

66
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,920
more than we can admit. When a couple

67
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,760
break up, when expensive lawyers are

68
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,000
called, we don't need to search for

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,720
explanations in the realm of values and

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,360
ends. We need to look squarely at the

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,280
love making. Did it happen often enough?

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
Did two people want it equally? Were

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,920
they each other's types? What were the

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,480
two kinks? And the tragedy is that so

75
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,120
often the problem lay in the very place

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,040
the couple could not bear to explore out

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
of a misplaced sense of what could

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,599
matter. They didn't want to think about

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,280
their so-called perverted sides. Neither

80
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,360
side wanted to own up to what turned

81
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,200
them on in private. They thought they

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,440
could overcome the shame of their

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,920
stranger visions by simply being very

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,080
nice. They believed sex wasn't in the

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,040
end as important as finding someone who

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,760
also loved modern art or canoeing. And

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,239
thereby they destroyed a substantial

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,159
portion of their lives. The more

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,319
experience we have, the more we're

90
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,959
likely to take seriously what every

91
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,560
adolescent knows. Sex is very

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,720
interesting, very strange, and very key.

93
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,120
We may be clever enough, but true

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,680
intelligence means properly letting our

95
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,959
baser, blunter, and more compelling

96
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,959
urges have their way.
